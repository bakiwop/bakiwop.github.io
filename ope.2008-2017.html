<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

the ex-clown told the world her story, which became known as "God's Circus" & was given as proof that god's chosen are humans, not clowns.
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

then, lightning struck each clown. giant floppy shoes flew off clown feet & red noses gave a final, pathetic honk. clown denouement.
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

the clowns, seeing her now as human, performed - for no clown can help but perform around humans. as the storm raged they threw cream pies.
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

save one young clown who stood her ground, stared up into the storm & cried, Human! as her baggy pants & oversized shoes filled with water.
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

it rained. the clowns ran, desperately hiding their faces from one another as their whiteface smeared, showing signs of their lost humanity.

Santa found my twitter acct (it's one of the ways he checks on people for his naughty/nice list) & saw my joke about water boarding an elf.
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

...non-stop. it's his favorite movie. he wouldn't even let me have so much as a candy cane for fear i'd gouge my eyes and ears out. ho ho ho

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

am weak with fear and hunger, and have never been so mentally abused. for the past 24 hours Claus has made me watch "Jingle All The Way"...

although he does set me free for an hour each day so i can go online and check my email & twitter. even Santa's not a complete monster.
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

so Santa got me to the North Pole without further incident, bound my hands & feet with garland & left me in a room surrounded with old toys.
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

turns out PETA filed a lawsuit against the feds for cruelty to animals (evidently for trying to blow up reindeer with f-16s).

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

and really, who knew 1) Santa was packing so much heat and 2) Rudolph's nose was a laser guide? joy to the world & peace on earth my ass.
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

it was a heck of a battle, but the f-16s didn't have a prayer against Santa & his 9 magic reindeer.
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

i peaked over the edge of the sleigh - past Santa, past Rudolph's red nose - & saw hope in the form of a dozen f-16s. i got down right quick
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

during my abduction a couple of days ago i got a text message from Special Agent Williams reading, "jet fghtrs cming now - get down!"
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

so here i am, shivering with cold & fear on the floor of his sleigh, wondering where he's taking me & what he'll do to me when we get there.
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

...& with Rudolph giving Santa only the smallest of hurt glances, the sleigh accelerated into the night, leaving the mob far behind...
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

...,"to the top of the hotel! to the top of the wall! now dash away! dash away! dash away all!"...
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

..., "now Dasher! now Dancer! now Prancer and Vixen! On Comet! on Cupid! on Donder and Blitzen!"...
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

...more rapid than eagles his courses they came, and he whistled and shouted and called them by name...
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

...the people behind me were pulling and grabbing, so i took Santa's hand and just missed a stabbing...
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

...said St. Nick, arm outstretched, with the only hope to give, "Come with me if you want to live."...
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

...when what to my wondering eyes should appear, but a really big sleigh & 9 mean ass reindeer...
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

...the lights from the lamps of the tv news shows, gave the lustre of mid-day to the mob below...
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

...away to the window i flew like a flash, tore open the shutters and threw up the sash...
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

...when outside the window i heard such a clatter, i ran across the room to see what was the matter...
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

...& Special Agent Williams got a message through saying they were trying to rescue me but were being thwarted at every turn by Claus...

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

...even worse, Santa's made sure i've had only Australian soap operas to occupy my time and the nearly empty mini-bar for sustenance...

day 2 stuck in the hotel room. the mob outside has swelled to over 100,000 people, the night made bright with 100's of burning effigies...
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

...i wish I cold say the same for me - i'm surrounded by 30,000 protesters, crazed elves, mad sugar plum fairies and the big man himself.

<h1>Feb 2010</h1>
<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

so the circus clowns & the rodeo clowns made peace, but as they left the bar they saw the childrens party clowns lurking in the shadows. fin
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

the circus clowns hesitated - rodeo clowns were their sworn whiteface enemies & yet they were trying to help a brother out. clown quandary.
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

the rodeo clowns leapt into action trying to distract the mechanical bull & save the fallen circus clown. rodeo clowns are brave, not smart.
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

as the rodeo clowns raised their hankies to attack, the circus clown riding the mechanical bull fell off & landed on a squirting flower.
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

a circus clown dropped & stepped on its whoopee cushion, breaking the spell of the mechanical bull riding circus clown for the rodeo clowns.







<h1>Jan 2010</h1>
<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

a circus clown hopped onto the bar's mechanical bull - the rodeo clowns couldn't help but watch. the circus clowns crept up behind them.
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

while fighting, a rodeo clown deftly repainted a circus clown's happy face to a sad one making the circus clown slump on a bar stool & sulk.
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

a circus clown sprayed a bottle of seltzer wildly, hitting friend & foe alike; a panicked circus clown is nobody's ally (save laughter's).
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

another circus clown tried to make a balloon animal bull to scare the rodeo clowns with, but in haste, made a giraffe instead. big mistake.
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

a rodeo clown threw the 1st punch, the fist landing squishingly on a circus clown's red nose with an AOOGA! before bouncing off harmlessly.
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

the rodeo clowns emerged from their barrels - with their sneakers they were confident they could outmaneuver their floppy-shoed adversaries.
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

seeing the rodeo clowns' hankies, the circus clowns dropped their kazoos & grabbed their own hankies from ears, noses & mouths. it was on.
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

the rodeo clowns dove into barrels for cover, slowly peeking over the edges, adjusting cowboy hats & brandishing hankies for the onslaught.
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

as the circus clowns burst through the bar's door they whistled Ennio Morricone's "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" theme on their kazoos.
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

the circus clowns tumbled out of their miniature car & flopped, in their big-shoed way, toward the rodeo clown bar. time for a reckoning.

a brief summer rain washed off the whiteface makeup revealing his true, sad face. the kids now cried when he handed them balloon animals.

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

...while at the same time hoping that the ex- vampire hunter/customer would finish him off and not, instead, make him a vampire as well...
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

...because really, who wants to hear a vampire going around saying things like, "i gots the mad undead skillz, yo!" before being killed ...
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

...honestly, just kill me please, ex-purveyor-of-fake-holy-water, and save me the bad gangsta-wannabe lingo...
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

...to which the undead ex-purveyor-of-fake-holy-water vampire would respond, "what da hell is 'ingo yo? is dat da thing dat ate dat baby?"..
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

...& then you'd be stuck explaining what 'lingo' meant to a vampire with the IQ of a jellyfish when he was just going to kill you anyway...
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

...& by the time you were done explaining it to him you'd really want the eternal embrace of death because he was THAT annoying...
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

...& then you'd be stuck with him for all eternity, hearing him say things like, "dag yo! playa had some mad blood up in dem veins!"...
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

...until one day, far in the annoying future, you'd realize that you just couldn't deal with him anymore and would contemplate suicide...
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

...but would initially despair because you were already dead - well, undead - and darned near immortal and thus pretty hard to kill, yo...
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

...& when you thought 'yo' you would redouble your efforts toward ending it all because you'd realize you were starting to speak like him...
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

...just as you were starting to drive the stake through your heart you'd be so pissed that he'd live while you died & then it hit you....
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

...you could end it all for yourself by killing him because he was your maker - every vampire he made would die if you killed him...
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

...you'd met many of the other vampires he'd made, they were just like him, saying "yo!" and "tru dat!" you'd be doing the world a favor...
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

...so that very night, with much glee & a light heart, you staked the annoying undead ex-purveyor-of-fake-holy-water vampire in the heart...
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

...as he turned to dust in front of you he blinked back a single blood tear and said, "bitchez!"...
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

...which made you feel bad for a moment until, from all around the earth, you heard thousands of undead scream, "bitchez!" before dying...
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

...then you'd wonder why you hadn't turned to dust with your maker & why you no longer craved blood or could turn into a vampire bat...
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

...you'd wander around for a while & then watch your 1st sunrise in over 100 years. you'd realize that god was pleased with your work...
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

...after the beautiful sunrise you'd slowly rise toward heaven and god would say to you, "mad propz on killing dat annoying vampire, yo!"...
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

...& then perhaps after hearing his silly speech you wouldn't feel so bad about him being killed by an undead ex- vampire hunter/customer...
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

...to which he would respond, "yo!" (because that's how he spoke) "have you seen the mad prices the priests are charging to bless da h20"...
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

...so why, might you ask, didn't he just go legit in the vampire hunter world & sell real holy water to vampire hunters in the 1st place...
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

...which would, you know, suck (both literally and figuratively) for him....
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

...and then, since he sold fake holy water, he wouldn't be able to protect himself against the undead ex- vampire hunter/customer...
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

...although the killed vampire hunter could potentially come back as an undead ex-vampire hunter and kill him for selling fake holy water...







<h1>Sep 2009</h1>
<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

...& if the vampire hunter used the fake holy water against a real vampire then they would most assuredly die & not be able to sue him ...
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

...and everyone - the vampire hunter & the "vampire" - could go home happy without the knowledge it wasn't real holy water he'd sold them...
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

...& if the vampire hunter used the fake holy water against a vampire they were chasing & lived then it wasn't a real vampire...
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

he sold fake holy water for $7/bottle figuring those who used it & lived didn't really need it & those who used it & died couldn't sue him.
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

she saw him at the reunion for the first time since high school. "you have a baby boy now? congrats on finally having sex once." she smiled.
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

she told her friends he had the body of a greek statue. he smiled at this until she explained about his pasty white skin and amputated arm.
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

he literally had a monkey on his back. ironically, to learn about addiction. "stupid corporate retreat," he mumbled as his team synergized.

she hated the 80s so she ran, she ran so far away, she just ran, she ran all night and day, she couldn't get away.
<br /><br />

smoking gun in hand he ran, tripping in his floppy shoes, landing honkingly on his big red nose, activating his jumbo seltzer squirt flower.

involuntary shudders, facial tics & caffeine shakes - waking up to another work week, she sure did feel lucky to have a job in this economy.
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

jobless & desperate, he leapt at the ice cream truck driver gig, but after a week of that music he was, now, desperate & looking to leap.
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

she walked in on him & her best friend. "liz," she said, "i'm so sorry. i told you he was awful in bed." liz nodded agreement. he whimpered.

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

the clowns were stuck in the tiny car, all twitches & muffled nose honks. the crowd roared laughter as the ringmaster called for the lions.
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

she loved driving fast & hated being passed - so when the ferrari blew by her followed by 8 cop cars & a news chopper she smiled. ready.
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

the construction workers had gone to a sexual harassment seminar the previous day & now felt bad, so today they whistled at ugly women, too.

he promised to follow her anywhere - a new city, a new job, to the ends of the earth, but he'd be damned if he'd hold her purse on the way.
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

she was petulant, had over 500,000 followers & loved "nwa" so she started her own elite twitter group: tweeters with attitude. #twa
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

he'd tried putting on a brave face for his 1st clownoholics anonymous meeting but had run out of whiteface, so he wore size 15 shoes instead
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

he walked up to the bar, elbowing his way past bikers & outlaws, grabbed the bartender by the throat & said, "shirley temple. straight."
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

when asked why he became a clown, he replied, "the tiny car." he could not bring himself to admit he did it for the honking red nose. honk!
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

he liked wearing wigs & makeup, they laughed cruelly, so he added a big red nose & sprayed them with seltzer, they laughed lovingly.
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

she became a clown for the shoes, the big floppy colorful shoes. she could now shop for shoes for her regular life & her clown life. bliss.
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

he knew he'd made it big when he saw his comedy show advertised (chicago theater, april 8) over the urinals by section 226 at wrigley field.
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

she called him a clown, amusing her mean friends, but she meant it literally. her secret shame was he clowned bar mitzvahs. and he was good.

figuring he'd be late again, she drank her dinner, so when he showed up early with anniversary gift in hand, she threw up gratefully.
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

she hated flying with her husband, who suffered from anterograde amnesia, because she'd have to join the mile high club over and over again.

jesus nailed to a cross for my sins? awkward! what kind of thank you note do i write for that? can i just text "thx?"
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

jesus died for my sins? before i committed any? i might have turned out to be a good guy - way to have faith in me, asshole!
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

i bet jesus found the guy who nailed him to the cross and gave him a swift kick to the groin for it.
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

if jesus had to die for my sins, instead of impalement upon a cross, couldn't he have just died of old age?
