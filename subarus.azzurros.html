<p align="center">

why so blue, subaru?<br />
ya got nothin' to do?<br />
sittin' there in the sun<br />
while they're out havin' fun<br />
in the sea and the sand<br />
while you three just stand<br />
parked facin' a bland<br />
wall?<br />
<br />

<p align="center">
y'all lie there in wait<br />
hours seven or eight<br />
resigned to your fate<br />
which cannot be great<br />
ne'er knowin' just when<br />
they'll drive you again<br />
and pull you from zen<br />
contemplation.<br />
<br />
of what do you think<br />
while they're sippin' their drink<br />
do you dream you can blink<br />
or just give a wink<br />
do you think big thoughts<br />
world peace with low cost<br />
help souls who're lost<br />
and alone?<br />
<br />
do you like your blue friends<br />
are ya buds to the end<br />
your spare tire you'll lend<br />
nothin' you'll not extend<br />
or ya hate bein' parked<br />
all your feels just stark<br />
mere feet from that dark<br />
group o' cars?<br />
<br />
or's the ganja i had<br />
last night just gone bad<br />
and left me off sad<br />
thinkin' thoughts myriad<br />
perhaps you're just cars<br />
sittin' out on the tar<br />
and my thoughts are just far<br />
and silly.<br />
