		<p>In the world of modern portable devices, it may be hard to believe that merely a few decades ago the most convenient way to keep track of time was a mechanical watch. Unlike their quartz and smart siblings, mechanical watches can run without using any batteries or other electronic components.</p>
		<p>Over the course of this article I’ll explain the workings of the mechanism seen in the demonstration below. You can drag the device around to change your viewing angle, and you can use the slider to peek at what’s going on inside:</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>In December 2021, an eruption began on Hunga Tonga–Hunga Haʻapai, a submarine volcano in the Tongan archipelago in the southern Pacific Ocean. The eruption reached a very large and powerful climax nearly four weeks later, on 15 January 2022. On the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/subjects/volcanoes/volcanic-explosivity-index.htm">Volcanic Explosivity Index scale</a>, the eruption was rated at least a VEI-5. Described by scientists as a "magma hammer", the volcano at its height produced a series of four underwater thrusts, displaced 10 cubic kilometres (2.4 cu mi) of rock, ash and sediment, and generated the largest atmospheric explosion recorded by modern instrumentation</p>
			<p>The eruption produced a volcanic tsunami that affected Tonga, Fiji, American Samoa, Vanuatu, New Zealand, Japan, the United States, the Russian Far East, Chile and Peru... tsunami waves up to 20 m (66 ft) high. Tsunami waves with run-up heights up to 45 m (148 ft) struck the uninhabited island of Tofua.</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>The eruption produced a massive eruption column, reaching heights of 57 kilometres (35 mi) and thus breaking into the mesosphere. This is the highest recorded eruption column since Krakatoa’s in 1883, which extended up to 80 km (50 mi) high. The column developed two "umbrella"-like clouds, one at 31 km (19 mi) in height and the other at 17 km (11 mi), and generated a terrestrial gamma-ray flash. The column ejected a large quantity of water into the stratosphere, where it disturbed the local temperature balance and caused the formation of anomalous winds.</p>
			<p>Large volcanic eruptions can inject large amounts of sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere, causing the formation of aerosol layers that reflect sunlight and can cause a cooling of the climate. In contrast, during the Hunga Tonga–Hunga Haʻapai eruption this sulfur was accompanied by large amounts of water vapour, which by acting as a greenhouse gas overrode the aerosol effect and caused a net warming of the climate system.</p>
			<p>Another study estimated that the water vapor will stay in the stratosphere for up to eight years, and influence winter weather in both hemispheres. More recent studies have indicated that the eruption had a slight cooling effect.</p>
			<p>In September 2023, the Antarctic ozone hole was one of the largest on record, at 26 million square kilometers. The anomalously large ozone loss may have been a result of the Hunga Tonga–Hunga Haʻapai eruption</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>Importantly, the atmospheric waves caused by the explosion coupled to the ocean, generating additional tsunamis at large distances from the volcano; volcanic tsunamis normally do not reach far from the edifice.</p>
			<p>Shockwaves from the eruption caused abnormally high waves along the coasts of Peru and Japan. The tsunami waves also struck the coasts earlier than had been forecast</p>
