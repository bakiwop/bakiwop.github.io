<![CDATA[
		<p><a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/Main/Home">Lone Wolf Books</a></p>
		<blockquote>
		<p>The Lone Wolf Books are Joe Dever's most popular series of gamebooks, set primarily in the mythical world of Magnamund in the universe of Aon (hence our name). You, the reader, play as Lone Wolf, a warrior-monk whose potential as a hero emerges from the tragic defeat of his teachers and kinsmen, known as the Kai Lords. These are solo adventures that can be read and interpreted at your leisure, bringing a unique experience to the reader. The most similar books to these that found a mainstream audience are the Choose Your Own Adventure and Fighting Fantasy series. In Lone Wolf, however, you do not only make key decisions in the text, but also choose your equipment and unique abilities, which may help you to survive through encounters that have both strategic and random elements. Lone Wolf books are also relatively unique in that the books can be read and played individually or as part of the larger series, where you can use skills and items gained from one book in another book. </p>		</blockquote>
		<blockquote>
		<p>"I would be especially pleased if my granting of the rights to distribute my books in this way was seen as my 'millennium gift' to all those devoted readers who have kept the Kai flag flying high, through all the good times, and the not-so-good. It would make me very proud indeed if this enterprise laid the foundations of a lasting legacy, securing the longevity of Lone Wolf by making my creation freely and readily accessible to current and future online generations. For them, for us, for Sommerlund and the Kai.…"</p>

<![CDATA[
		<p>Library Courier is a very dangerous job in the library world. Shuttling books back and forth ain’t for the faint of heart. As you can see from the picture below, the courier needs protection from the library books. It’s not that the books are evil as such, but they are off the shelf and away from their friends which means they’re scared, confused, and likely to attack until they find themselves back in a library or in the hands of a patron.</p>
		<p>Nothing is better to a library book than being in the hands of a patron.</p>
		<p>This van just had new security equipment installed but the courier is far braver than I, those books could muscle through those bars at any moment and do some serious damage.</p>

This is one of the reasons why. <a href="https://tracydurnell.com/2025/07/11/weeknotes-july-5-11-2025/">This right here:</a></p>
		<blockquote>
		received a reply from my House rep — I’d written in saying I questioned her commitment to our laws for voting to table impeachment, she said yeah what the president did was unconstitutional but we were never gonna win and it would have looked partisan… so basically, confirming her lack of commitment to law in favor of "politics"

			<description>hiccup cure</description>
			<content:encoded>
<![CDATA[
		<p>To cure hiccups, get a glass of water and a pen or pencil. Place the pen or pencil inside your mouth and lightly bite down on it. Drink the glass of water.</p>
		<p>This may be a tad messy.</p>
		<p>Remove pen or pencil from  mouth. Enjoy your hiccup-free existence.</p>
		<p>Bonus points: To avoid potential gastric distress, wash the pen or pencil before you place it in your mouth.</p>
		<p>Unless you're into that sorta thing.</p>
		<p>I do not judge.</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>The final line of the song (in the studio, live, and "Blurred Vision" versions, in the album and extended versions the line before the final "God works in mysterious ways... Mysterious ways...") is "fried chicken", although the lyrics say "one vision".</p>

		<p><a href="https://amazingribs.com/more-technique-and-science/more-cooking-science/reactive-pans/">Beware Of The “Lasagna Cell”: The Danger Of Food And Metals</a></p>
		<blockquote>
		<p>Reactive pots and pans made of aluminum, cast iron, hammered steel, brass, or copper can react with some chemicals in foods, especially the acids and salts in sauces, brines, and marinades, and they can undergo a chemical reaction and create off flavors, and in rare cases, are toxic.</p>
		<p>Perhaps the most extreme example is the lasagna cell. Lasagna lovers often are appalled when they open the fridge or oven and find holes in the foil on top of the pan and black spots on their dinner.</p>
		<p>For a better understanding of the process, I asked the AmazingRibs.com science advisor Prof. Greg Blonder. He explained that the cook has essentially created a small battery, a cell, and the electric current running through it has etched away one of the battery’s electrodes. Huh?</p>
