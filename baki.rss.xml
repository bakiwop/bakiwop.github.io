			<p>In the early days of the web, pages were made primarily by hobbyists, academics, and computer savvy people about subjects they were personally interested in. Later on, the web became saturated with commercial pages that overcrowded everything else. All the personalized websites are hidden among a pile of commercial pages. Google isn't great at finding them, its focus is on finding answers to technical questions, and it works well; but finding things you didn't know you wanted to know, which was the real joy of web surfing, no longer happens. In addition, many pages today are created using bloated scripts that add slick cosmetic features in order to mask the lack of content available on them. Those pages contribute to the blandness of today's web. </p>
			<p>The Wiby search engine is building a web of pages as it was in the earlier days of the internet. In addition, Wiby helps vintage computers to continue browsing the web, as pages indexed are more suitable for their performance. </p>

			<description>The U.S. government tried denying James Joyce's Ulysses "admittance into the United States." </description>

		<p>The U.S. government tried denying <a href="https://search.worldcat.org/search?slug=1108727116&q=ti%3Aulysses+AND+au%3Ajames+joyce">James Joyce's <cite>Ulysses</cite></a> "admittance into the United States." <a referrerpolicy="no-referrer" href="https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/5/182/2250768/">The government's motion was for a decree of forfeiture and destruction.</a> The judge read the book to determine what was what. Here's some of what he said about it.</p>
		<p>It would've been too difficult for a jury to read it:</p>
			<blockquote>It seems to me that a procedure of this kind is highly appropriate in libels such as this for the confiscation of books. It is an especially advantageous procedure in the instant case because, on account of the length of "Ulysses" and the difficulty of reading it, a jury trial would have been an extremely unsatisfactory, if not an almost impossible method of dealing with it.</blockquote>
		<br />
		<p>The judge liked and loathed the book:</p>
			<blockquote>Furthermore, "Ulysses" is an amazing tour de force when one considers the success which has been in the main achieved with such a difficult objective as Joyce set for himself. As I have stated, "Ulysses" is not an easy book to read. It is brilliant and dull, intelligible and obscure, by turns. In many places it seems to me to be disgusting, but although it contains, as I have mentioned above, many words usually considered dirty, I have not found anything that I consider to be dirt for dirt's sake. Each word of the book contributes like a bit of mosaic to the detail of the picture which Joyce is seeking to construct for his readers. </blockquote>
		<br />
		<p><cite>Ulysses</cite> was sexy but not sexy:</p>
			<blockquote>...reading "Ulysses" in its entirety, as a book must be read on such a test as this, did not tend to excite sexual impulses or lustful thoughts, but that its net effect on them was only that of a somewhat tragic and very powerful commentary on the inner lives of men and women..."Ulysses" may, therefore, be admitted into the United States. </blockquote>

		<p>Sunday 03 August 2025</p>
		<p>Miles ridden this week: 440. Rediscovering some paved(ish) back roads I haven't been on in years.</p>
			<p align="center">- - -</p>
		<p>Hours writing: 0. Blech. Excuse du jour? Trying to get the <a href="https://baki.cc/archivio.antico.html">archivio.antico</a> sorted - will take a while.</p>	
			<p align="center">- - -</p>
		<p>Notable patron interactions from the previous week:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>A patron who read Dostoevsky's <cite><a href="https://search.worldcat.org/title/52578655">The Idiot</a></cite> as a 10-year-old (they liked the title) is now, at 85, reading it again to see what they think of it seven-and-a-half decades later. Wonder if it will hold up.</li>
			<li>Told a patron that they didn't have to go home but they couldn't stay here when we were about a minute from closing. They couldn't decide between three Tom Clancy novels. I told them they should take all three and if there were any they didn't like they'd get their money back. Library humor.</li>
			<li>Got cussed out in two languages by a long-time regular. They started by calling me fucking lazy because I sit at the reference desk all day. I tried explaining that, as a reference librarian, sitting at the reference desk is the majority of my job. They didn't much care for that line of reasoning and went on to explain their position vociferously and multilingually. Let them know they can think whatever they like, but cussing out staff is inappropriate behavior and if they continued they'd have to leave for the day. They continued then left for the day.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Interview with the public library in Flagstaff, AZ. Another cool place. Just like last week, still not sure about pay cut (only ~$25k/yr this time around) and what effect it would have on pension and potential retirement. The conundrum: do we settle for the pretty nifty life we have here and travel lots or possibly hurt our chances of retirement but move around every few years.</p>
			<p align="center">- - -</p>
		<p>Stopped taking two of my four allergy shots a month ago. Starting to feel the negative effects of that decision. Fingers crossed things don't get too bad.</p>
			<p align="center">- - -</p>
		<p>Father memory: We had a football game we'd play: make it across the big back yard (about 30 meters) in four passing plays, then three passing plays, then two passing plays, then in one passing play.</p>
