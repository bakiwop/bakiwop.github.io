		<p><a href="https://apnews.com/article/japan-russia-kamchatka-earthquake-tsunami-warning-a88cbe8a1e985cff54dc0ad849ea5ddb">Tsunami Warning for, basically, the entire coast of every continent on the Pacific Ocean</a> due to the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/deadly-earthquakes-tsunamis-largest-24ba9c91359567e09016a38021f66f0f">"8.8 magnitude temblor"</a> in Russia's far east.</p>
		<p>Because math is groovy, the <a href="https://www.tsunami.gov/?page=tsunamiFAQ">U.S. Tsunami Warning System</a> was able to predict how high the tsunami would be and when it would hit.</p>	
		<p>Evidently tsunamis can travel across the Pacific Ocean at 500mph. It still takes half a day or more for the tsunami to cross the Pacific.</p>
		<p>Good advice to to stay off the beaches and <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@44.9580949,-124.0202522,3a,53.8y,354.15h,64.65t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1s0-HFQ2J0k-KbBVcR5ceHQA!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fcb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile%26w%3D900%26h%3D600%26pitch%3D25.346407712224234%26panoid%3D0-HFQ2J0k-KbBVcR5ceHQA%26yaw%3D354.14716514227774!7i13312!8i6656?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDcyNy4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D">above the "Leaving the Tsunami Zone" lines/waves painted on all the streets around here</a>.</p>
		<p>The prediction for Lincoln City was a tsunami of less than a foot to hit at 11:55pm PST. We decided to go to bed rather than head to a neighbor's on the cliffs overlooking the ocean to watch it.</p>

			<description>tng - skant</description>
			<content:encoded>
<![CDATA[
		<p><a href="https://startrekcostumeguide.com/tng-uniforms/tng-skant/costume-analysis/uniform-analysis/">TNG Skant – Uniform Analysis</a> by Obsessive Costuming Dude at the <a href="https://startrekcostumeguide.com">Star Trek Costume Guide</a> (<a href="https://startrekcostumeguide.com/sewing-patterns/">including sewing patterns</a>).</p>
		<p>Very detailed info on the skant. For example:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>As with all of William Ware Theiss’ TNG-era Starfleet uniform designs, the TNG skants were made of jumbo spandex (except the neckline/yoke piping, which was a lighter-weight spandex). Also typical of Theiss’ TNG-era uniforms, the jumbo spandex was cut with the fabric “weave” oriented horizontally, so the fabric stretched vertically (instead of around the wearer’s body).</p>
		</blockquote>
		<blockquote>
			<p>The neckline on the screen-used women’s TNG skant I examined was only about 4 ¾” at its widest – about where the shoulder seams were. The lower yoke extended over the shoulder onto the upper sleeve, cut as a continuous piece; there was no “traditional” upper armscye seam.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<blockquote>
			<p>Here, you can see the slight color/sheen differences between the jumbo spandex and lightweight spandex used for the neckline/yoke trim.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<blockquote>
			<p>Both the front and back yokes were actually two separate pieces (upper front yoke, lower front yoke, upper back yoke, lower back yoke), with a seam establishing the contour of the yoke piping. The strip of lightweight spandex (used for the yoke piping) was sewn into the yoke seam, and the allowances were pressed upward. </p>
		</blockquote>
		<blockquote>
			<p>The center front yoke depth of the TNG skant appears to have been comparable to that on the early TNG jumpsuit, although both varied considerably. As you might recall from my TNG jumpsuit analysis, the yoke depth on the jumpsuits fluctuated over the course of the first season and grew significantly deeper over the course of season two.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<blockquote>
			<p>On the screen-used women’s TNG skant I examined, the vent was 12” on the front panel, but the side panel was slightly shorter, with the vent only being about 11 ¼” tall. The vent allowances were simply turned under and hand-sewn into place via catch-stitching. Curiously, the front vent’s hem allowance was 2″ at the top of the vent, but this widened to 2 ⅜” at the bottom of the vent.</p>

			<li>Helped former IT guy who suffered a stroke get <a href="https://www.overdrive.com/apps/libby">Libby</a> working. He and wife were very grateful. Wife took me aside later and told me husband was so relieved I didn't make him feel "stupid and incompetent."</li>
			<li>Patron told me they didn't have any friends and I was the only one they could joke around and smile with.</li>
			<li>Patron came in very frustrated and angry about having to make copies. Didn't know how to do it. I showed them how. After copies were made they were even angrier and more frustrated I didn't do it for them.</li>
			<li>Patron let me know people were controlling the weather. When I asked how that was possible they suggested I look it up online to learn all about it.</li>
			<li>Found proselytizing post-it in the stacks. "Jeremiah 31:3: I have always loved you and I always will love you."</li>

		<blockquote>
		<p>At the end? Bob died yesterday afternoon (May 22, 2008). A peaceful death, by all accounts, dozing on a sofa with a Terry Pratchett book still open in his hands. Unexpected? yes. Surprising? no, not really.</p>

			<description>Lone Wolf Books</description>
			<content:encoded>
<![CDATA[
		<p><a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/Main/Home">Lone Wolf Books</a></p>
		<blockquote>
		<p>The Lone Wolf Books are Joe Dever's most popular series of gamebooks, set primarily in the mythical world of Magnamund in the universe of Aon (hence our name). You, the reader, play as Lone Wolf, a warrior-monk whose potential as a hero emerges from the tragic defeat of his teachers and kinsmen, known as the Kai Lords. These are solo adventures that can be read and interpreted at your leisure, bringing a unique experience to the reader. The most similar books to these that found a mainstream audience are the Choose Your Own Adventure and Fighting Fantasy series. In Lone Wolf, however, you do not only make key decisions in the text, but also choose your equipment and unique abilities, which may help you to survive through encounters that have both strategic and random elements. Lone Wolf books are also relatively unique in that the books can be read and played individually or as part of the larger series, where you can use skills and items gained from one book in another book. </p>		</blockquote>
		<blockquote>
		<p>"I would be especially pleased if my granting of the rights to distribute my books in this way was seen as my 'millennium gift' to all those devoted readers who have kept the Kai flag flying high, through all the good times, and the not-so-good. It would make me very proud indeed if this enterprise laid the foundations of a lasting legacy, securing the longevity of Lone Wolf by making my creation freely and readily accessible to current and future online generations. For them, for us, for Sommerlund and the Kai.…"</p>

			<description>library courier danger.</description>

<![CDATA[
		<p>Library Courier is a very dangerous job in the library world. Shuttling books back and forth ain’t for the faint of heart. As you can see from the picture below, the courier needs protection from the library books. It’s not that the books are evil as such, but they are off the shelf and away from their friends which means they’re scared, confused, and likely to attack until they find themselves back in a library or in the hands of a patron.</p>
		<p>Nothing is better to a library book than being in the hands of a patron.</p>
		<p>This van just had new security equipment installed but the courier is far braver than I, those books could muscle through those bars at any moment and do some serious damage.</p>

		<blockquote>
		received a reply from my House rep — I’d written in saying I questioned her commitment to our laws for voting to table impeachment, she said yeah what the president did was unconstitutional but we were never gonna win and it would have looked partisan… so basically, confirming her lack of commitment to law in favor of "politics"
