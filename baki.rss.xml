<![CDATA[
		<p><a href="https://www.wstx.us/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=916">Beloved library cat has passed away</a></p>
		<blockquote>
		<p>It is with heavy hearts that we inform you of the passing of Browser, the beloved library cat. Browser passed away peacefully of natural causes. He was one month shy of sixteen years old. In 2010, the Library staff was inspired by the story of Dewey Readmore Books, an Iowa library cat who had a book written about him, and adopted Browser to be a library cat when he was just 1 year old. Browser spent fifteen years of his life at the White Settlement Public Library and was one of their longest tenured employees. Browser brought delight to patrons and employees over the past decade and a half with his playful and curious nature, often cozying up to people while they read and worked. Some of his favorite activities included riding the book return cart while employees returned books to the shelves, stealing the Library Managerâ€™s seat any time she got up, watching bird videos, and hanging with the crafting club any time they met. Browser sat in on so many GED classes at the library that the teacher eventually awarded him an honorary GED. On behalf of the entire Library staff past and present, we would like to thank all who went out of their way to visit Browser, play with him, and remind him how good of a boy he was. He lived a full and joyful life that was filled with friends.</p>
