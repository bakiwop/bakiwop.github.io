			<description>I found the book and handed it to the patron. The look they gave me makes me fear I may have just started them on their villain arc.</description>
			<content:encoded>
<![CDATA[
		<p>I upset a patron the other day. A teen with their mother. They were all over the nonfiction section, occasionally stopping to look at the catalog on their phone, finding then pulling book after book. After awhile they'd amassed a sizable pile to lug around.</p>
		<p>They didn't seem to need my help and I was happy not to give it.</p>
		<p>A bit later they walked up to my desk and said they couldn't find one. I asked for the title. The patron told me, and as I typed it into my search they said, "I have it right here." I looked up. They were holding their phone out to me. There it was, the book in our catalog.</p>
		<p>"Fantastic," I said. I turned back to my computer, turned the screen so they could see it, and continued searching.</p>
		<p>"But I have it right here," they said.</p>
		<p>I looked up, smiled, and told them I had access to a slightly different catalog.</p>
		<p>Cue betrayal face.</p>
		<p>I pointed to the screen to show them when the book had last been checked in (today) and told them it was probably over in circ waiting to hop on one of the shelving carts. Said they should give me a couple moments and I'd go check.</p>
		<p>As I got up from the desk, the patron looked at their mother and said, "that's cheating." Mom smiled sympathetically.</p>
		<p>I found the book and handed it to the patron. The look they gave me makes me fear I may have just started them on their villain arc.</p>

<![CDATA[
		<p><a href="https://www.nasa.gov/solar-system/nasas-webb-scores-another-ringed-world-with-new-image-of-uranus/">NASA’s Webb Scores Another Ringed World With New Image of Uranus</a></p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>The new image features dramatic rings as well as bright features in the planet’s atmosphere. The Webb data demonstrates the observatory’s unprecedented sensitivity for the faintest dusty rings, which have only ever been imaged by two other facilities: the Voyager 2 spacecraft as it flew past the planet in 1986, and the Keck Observatory with advanced adaptive optics. The seventh planet from the Sun, Uranus is unique: It rotates on its side, at roughly a 90-degree angle from the plane of its orbit. This causes extreme seasons since the planet’s poles experience many years of constant sunlight followed by an equal number of years of complete darkness. (Uranus takes 84 years to orbit the Sun.)</p>

			<description>NASA true color image of Io.</description>
			<content:encoded>
<![CDATA[
		<p><a href="https://science.nasa.gov/resource/global-image-of-io-true-color/">NASA true color image of Io</a></p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>NASA's Galileo spacecraft acquired its highest resolution images of Jupiter's moon Io on 3 July 1999 during its closest pass to Io since orbit insertion in late 1995. This color mosaic uses the near-infrared, green and violet filters (slightly more than the visible range) of the spacecraft's camera and approximates what the human eye would see. Most of Io's surface has pastel colors, punctuated by black, brown, green, orange, and red units near the active volcanic centers. A false color version of the mosaic has been created to enhance the contrast of the color variations.</p>

		<p align="center">Thought it'd be nifty to see wild horses. Always imagined them running in herds on the open plains. Seeing them in the forest was unexpected, but duh, it's a national <em>forest</em>.</p>

		<p align="center">Thought we'd have to drive deep into the forest to see some horses, so we took some interesting roads.</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>Photographer Tony Austin knew he had gotten lucky when a murder of crows landed near him on a recent nature walk. But then one of the birds started acting strangely. Austin started shooting — and he was astounded later, when he enlarged his photos: The crow had large black ants all over its body.</p>
			<p>A leading theory is that it's all about cleanliness.</p>
			<p>"Ants have defensive secretions, chemical weapons they use to fight off other insects and fungi, so if you smear what they've got all over your feathers, you're stealing their fungicides, miticides, insecticides and biocides," as Robert Krulwich reported for NPR.</p>

		<blockquote>
			A kakistocracy (/ˌkækɪˈstɒkrəsi/ KAK-ist-OK-rə-see) is a government run by the worst, least qualified, or most unscrupulous citizens. The word was coined as early as the 17th century, and is derived from two Greek words, kákistos (κάκιστος, 'worst') and krátos (κράτος, 'rule'), with a literal meaning of 'government by the worst people.'

			<title>Spiders</title>
			<link>https://baki.cc/serial.1.html#11</link>
			<description>Little fucker. I'm naked on the toilet and your come at me when I haven't even had my morning coffee? Fuck off with that shit.</description>
			<content:encoded>
<![CDATA[
	<a id="11"></a>
		<p>Spiders.</p>
		<p>Friggin' spiders.</p>
		<p>Lots of spiders make their way into the house.</p>
		<p>Like, lots.</p>
		<p>It'd gotten so bad I'd find spiders in my bathroom daily.</p>
		<p>And not the cute little spider buddies with webs in a corner that eat pests and want you to leave them alone. Nope. These spiders were quick and mean - oh so mean! - and scurried all over the place. They looked like wolf spiders, but they were black.</p>
		<p>Are there even black wolf spiders?</p>
		<p>And mean. Did I already mention mean? Don't think a spider can be mean? One morning I woke up and blearily made my way to the banister overlooking the stairs so I could tell my wife and kitty i love them. As my hand brushed the railing it bumped something. It barely registered. I was still mostly asleep. I thought to myself, <em>wouldn't it be funny if that was a spider</em>, then yelled down, "Love you!" to my girls. I turned, shuffled my way down the hall, and went into the bathroom.</p>
		<p>I took off my PJs and sat on the toilet, and as I sat there, trying to wake up, I saw this black spider crawl under the door, turn toward me, then run - yes, run - right at me.</p>
		<p>Little fucker. I'm naked on the toilet and your come at me when I haven't even had my morning coffee?</p>
		<p>Fuck off with that shit.</p>
		<p>I grabbed a roll of toilet paper - the only thing at hand - and sent it to its eight-legged maker.</p>
		<p>Shit.</p>
		<p>And these spiders? Whatever kind they are? They don't seem to spin webs. In fact, I've only seen them use spider silk once.</p>
		<p>It was just the other day.</p>
		<p>You see, nowadays, we have a guy come out and spray chemicals all over the inside and outside of the house.</p>
		<p>Chemical warfare! Science! Opposable thumbs, bitches!</p>
		<p>This guy comes out every couple of months. But that last few weeks before the guy comes out again? The spiders start coming 'round.</p>
		<p>But now? Now I'm prepared.</p>
		<p>So, spider silk. Right. Just the other day, I was using the bathroom facilities. I finished my business, stood up, spun the toilet paper roll, and out shot a spider.</p>
		<p>It was waiting for me in the damned toilet paper roll.</p>
		<p>Mother. Fucker.</p>
		<p>But like I said, now? Now I'm prepared. Oh yes, now that I know that these spiders come back a week or two before the chemical warfare guy comes once again to spray chemical arachnid death, I  make sure I have a book at hand.</p>
		<p>A nice, thick, hardcover book with a dust jacket that cleans off easily after morte di ragno.</p>
		<p>I'm a librarian, fuckers! I ain't never running out of books to squash y'all with!</p>
		<p>So the spider popped out the cardboard toilet paper roll and went down it's little silk lifeline to the floor. It ran toward a piece of trim it could scuttle under.</p>
		<p>Bam!</p>
		<p>Down came Stephen King's <cite>Misery</cite> to end its miserable little life.</p>
		<p>There may be lots of spiders, but every time <cite>Misery</cite> comes out? There's one less.</p>

<![CDATA[
		<p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-30958073">Divers caught in sperm whale's giant underwater poo cloud</a></p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>When Keri Wilk dived into clear waters off the island of Dominica, swimming through a massive whale poo was not in the plan. But it's what happened.</p>
			<p>"At first, it seemed like a regular bowel movement," Keri explained.</p>
			<p>"But rather than continuing its dive down, it remained at the surface and continued to defecate for a startling length of time.</p>
			<p>The "poonado" then spread through the water - ending up in Keri's mouth - as the whale flapped its tail.</p>
