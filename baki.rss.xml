		<blockquote>
			<p>When Keri Wilk dived into clear waters off the island of Dominica, swimming through a massive whale poo was not in the plan. But it's what happened.</p>
			<p>"At first, it seemed like a regular bowel movement," Keri explained.</p>
			<p>"But rather than continuing its dive down, it remained at the surface and continued to defecate for a startling length of time.</p>
			<p>The "poonado" then spread through the water - ending up in Keri's mouth - as the whale flapped its tail.</p>
