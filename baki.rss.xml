		<p>I really hope this gets rid of <a href="serial.14.html#131">my earworm</a>, because 24 hours is too much. Oh so very too much.</p>
		<p>Library lyrics for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voRoKJSd5Lw">WKRP IN Cincinnati Main Theme</a>:</p>
		<p>
			Baby, if you've ever wondered<br />
			Wondered whatever became of me<br />
			I'm living in the stacks in Lincoln City<br />
			Lincoln City, Driftwood Library<br />
			<br />
			Got kinda tired of packin' and unpackin'<br />
			books from my, own home library<br />
			Maybe you and me were never meant to be<br />
			Just get a library book once in a while<br />
			<br />
			Headin' up that highway, leavin' you behind<br />
			Hardest thing I ever had to do<br />
			Broke my heart in two, to charge you, late fee fines<br />
			The price for findin' books was losin' you<br />
			<br />
			Memories help me hide my lonesome feelin'<br />
			Reading books keeps me from feelin' low<br />
			It's gettin' late, my friend, my love, I miss you so<br />
			Time to close this book, I've gotta go<br />
			<br />
			Baby, if you've ever wondered<br />
			Wondered whatever became of me<br />
			I'm living in the stacks in Lincoln City<br />
			Lincoln City, Driftwood Library<br />
			<br />
			Got kinda tired of packin' and unpackin'<br />
			books from my, own home library<br />
			Maybe you and me were never meant to be<br />
			Just get a library book once in a while<br />
			<br />
			I'm at Driftwood Library in Lincoln City<br />

<![CDATA[
		<p>Went to see Chuck Tingle last night. Was groovy. Bought the new book, <a href="https://search.worldcat.org/title/1452439900"><cite>Lucky Day</cite></a>. $28! Books are so expensive! Thank goodness for libraries, but sometimes you just gotta own the book.</p>
		<p>There was a very enthusiastic crowd. Here we were playing guess the real title of the book. #2 was not it, though I may have to try to write a book with the title, <cite>Slammed by the Four Year Overdue Library Book That I just Found Under My Bed</cite>.

		<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/08/physics-of-badmintons-new-killer-spin-serve/">Physics of badminton’s new killer spin serve </a></p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>Serious badminton players are constantly exploring different techniques to give them an edge over opponents. One of the latest innovations is the spin serve, a devastatingly effective method in which a player adds a pre-spin just before the racket contacts the shuttlecock (aka the birdie). It's so effective—some have called it "impossible to return"—that the Badminton World Federation (BWF) banned the spin serve in 2023, at least until after the 2024 Paralympic Games in Paris.</p>

			<p>And just how many people would join Starfleet to get selfies that no one else could so they'd get more followers? "Here's me going warp 8." "Here's me in the Borg cube." "Here's me doing the 'get shot by a phaser set to stun' challenge." Would prank vids for Youtube get out of control? Would cadets decompress fellow cadets' space suits during space walks? "Sorry, Cadet Peters, I know your lungs partially ruptured, but it was just a prank, bro! You should've totally exhaled, dude!"</p>
		</blockquote>
		<blockquote>
			<p> Or would it be just too darned hard to log in? Facebook: "We see you're logging in from an unusual star system, we have sent a code to your email, enter it here to continue." Only you ticked off the Comms Specialist by beating them in poker so they are being a little bitch about it and blocking your email from penetrating the shield that is currently up because the Enterprise came across a Romulan Bird-of-Prey in the Neutral Zone.</p>

			<description>spiders</description>

<![CDATA[
		<p>Spiders suck.</p>
		<p>Totally suck.</p>
		<p>Absolutely completely utterly suck.</p>
		<p>And I know. I know. We're supposed to be cool with spiders nowadays. Spider Bros, they say. They eat all the pests in your house, they say. They're more scared of you then you are of them, the say.</p>
		<p>You know what I say?</p>
		<p>Get bent spiders!</p>
		<p>I don't know if it's a PNW thing or what, but these big, evil looking spiders that make their way into our house are...not...cool, man!</p>
		<p>This one time, I woke up. Good start to the day, right? Waking up? So I wake up, get out of bed, shuffle my way to the railing overlooking the stairs to the first floor of our house, and, as I put my hands on the railing, still half asleep and eyes mostly shut, my hand brushes something off the railing.</p>
		<p><em>Huh</em>, I think to myself, but, you know, barely, because conscious thought isn't really part of my reality that early in the morning, <em>wouldn't it be funny if that were a spider</em>? And that was it. As soon as I thought the thought I forgot the thought. It dropped out of my consciousness. I yell, "Love you!" to my wife and "Sweet Pea!" to my cat, and, with my day started properly I shuffle off to the bathroom to do bathroom-type things.</p>
		<p>As I sat down on the toilet, I noticed a black blur out of the corner of my eye. I turned my head to see a big black spider crawl under the door and into the bathroom. It stopped, turned toward me, and ran.</p>
		<p>"Bro!" I said.</p>
		<p>It stopped and said, "Sup!"</p>
		<p>I said, "You did not just crawl under the bathroom door to come at me!"</p>
		<p>It replied, "You did not just knock me off that railing!"</p>
		<p>"Bruh," I insisted. "I was asleep! I didn't know you were there!"</p>
		<p>"Well that makes it all okay then doesn't it," it sassed, slowly crawling toward me.</p>
		<p>"Bruh!" I reiterated.</p>
		<p>"Bruv!" It replied, stopping again. "You done fucked around now you're gonna find out!" It ran toward me again.</p>
		<p>"Not cool!" I replied. "I got my drawers down over here trying to take a dump!"</p>
		<p>"Like a bitchass chump," it said, still coming at me.</p>
		<p>"Stop!" I yelled, standing up. "Don't start nuthin, won't be nuthin!"</p>
		<p>"Big talk," it said, then stopped right in front of me. It focused all eight of its eyes on my private parts and continued, "for a little man."</p>
		<p>"You little fucker!" I said as he closed the last of the gap between us.</p>
		<p>"Is that what your wife calls it?"</p>
		<p>I grabbed the box of tissues from the top of the toilet tank behind me and brought it down right on top of it. I lifted the box and saw the spider's legs begin to curl up. It's eyes focused on me briefly, so I said, "Bitch, please," then saw eight points of light fade into darkness.</p>
		<p>Then there was this other time. I was sitting on the toilet again. I don't want to paint too much of a picture here, but I had just finished my business and went to grab toilet paper to, you know, complete the transaction, so I roll the toilet paper and out shoots another big evil spider! Out Of the toilet roll! It drops a little piece of silk on the edge of the roll and it rappels down to the ground then scutters under the nearest floorboard trim.</p>
		<p>It was waiting for me in the toilet paper roll.</p>
		<p>Little fucker.</p>
		<p>It was waiting for me in the toilet paper roll!</p>
		<p>Goddamn arachnids!</p>
		<p>It was waiting...</p>
		<p>...for me...</p>
		<p>...in the toilet paper roll.</p>
		<p>That's how it wants to come at me? When my pants are down around my ankles?</p>
		<p>So yeah, you can talk all you want about ecological balance and spider bros and how beneficial they are and how much better off we are that they're around.</p>
		<p>You're wrong.</p>
		<p>Spiders suck.</p>
		<p>Totally suck.</p>
		<p>Absolutely completely utterly suck.</p>

		<p>Miles riding: 718. Tried doing some off pavement riding (forest roads and the like) but couldn't because of fire hazards from drought conditions up in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_Coast_Range">Coastal Range</a>. Did some longer distance riding instead. Also got hand guards and skid plate to make off pavement riding safer for <a href="serial.10.html#93">Mabel</a> when I can use the trails again.</p>
		<p>Hours writing: 0.</p>
