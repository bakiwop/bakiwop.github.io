			<description>Crater Lake</description>

<![CDATA[
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crater_Lake">Crater Lake</a> is amazing. It's a volcanic crater whose rim sits at 8,000 feet. The caldera is 2,148 feet (about half a mile) deep and was formed when Mount Mazama collapsed. No rivers flow in or out of the lake. The lake itself is 1,949 feet deep which makes it the deepest lake in the U.S.. There is a thirty foot tall tree stump that has bobbed vertically in the lake for over a center whose name is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Man_of_the_Lake">The Old Man of the Lake.</a></p>

		<p><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/57751277">How do you wash your clothes in space?</a></p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>So how do astronauts do their laundry in space? Well the answer is, they don't! </p>
			<p>There does come a time when astronauts have to get rid of some of their dirty clothes. Some of them are put in cargo spacecrafts which burn up in the Earth's atmosphere, while other more expensive items like spacesuits are sent back to Earth for cleaning and repairs.</p>
			<p>Now, Nasa is looking for a way to clean astronauts clothing so they don't have to be thrown away.</p>
