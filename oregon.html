King Tides
</h2>

<p>Winter is king tide season on the Oregon Coast. <a href="https://www.oregoncoast.org/blog/oregon-king-tides/">King tides</a> are tides that, "get higher than other times of the year. They occur when the Moon's orbit is closest to the Earth, the Earth's orbit is closest to the Sun, and the Sun, Moon, and Earth are in alignment. This alignment increases their gravitational pull, which affects the tides. The official term is perigean spring tides, otherwise known as King Tides." What does this mean practically? Wicked cool surf.</p>
<p>For example, here's the <a href="https://www.oregoncoast.org/blog/beach-blog-april-2017/">Joe the Sea Lion statue</a> in Lincoln City, OR at the 35th St Beach Access (another groovy thing about Oregon, <a href="https://www.oregon.gov/lcd/OCMP/Pages/Public-Access.aspx">the entire 363(ish) miles of coastline is public - no private ownership allowed</a>) at a fairly normal tide level:</p>

<br />
<p>This is what the Joe Sea Lion statue looks like during a particularly nifty king tide:</p>

<p>Watch about 30 seconds of this vid to see what happens to Joe the Sea Lion during king tide: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yk0yuKSeoV0&t=22s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yk0yuKSeoV0&t=22s</a></p>

<br />
<p>Another example? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D_River">D River</a> in Lincoln city, OR. D River, claimed to be the world's shortest river (a surprisingly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D_River#World_record_dispute">contentious title</a> leading to shade thrown like "ocean water backup" and "drainage ditch surveyed for a school project") during a normal tide (notice the couple hundred feet of beach leading up to the pillars of the building on the right):</p>

<p>This is D River during a king tide:</p>

<p>Watch about 30 seconds of this vid (same video as above, but the time stamp is different) to see what happens at D River during king tide: <A href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yk0yuKSeoV0&t=166s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yk0yuKSeoV0&t=166s</a></p>

<p>If you go ahead and watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yk0yuKSeoV0">entire video</a> you'll notice a couple of things. People really like king tides and put themselves in danger watching and/or playing in them. <a href="https://www.northcoastjournal.com/NewsBlog/archives/2020/01/13/dramatic-video-shows-how-sneaky-sneaker-waves-can-be">Bad move.</a> The ocean will drag you into its fifty degree (Fahrenheit, natch)  embrace <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hKscdTX20s">without warning while you're wearing all your winter/rain gear</a>, between the shock of the cold and the weight of your clothes you're in serious trouble.</p>
<p>The other thing to notice? Logs. There are a lot of logs thrown up by the ocean on the Oregon Coast:</p>
<p class="embiggen"><img src="oregon.lotta.logs.png" width="90%" alt="Lotta logs." title="Lotta logs." /></p>
<br />
<p>This leads to <a href="https://visitrockawaybeach.org/bonfires/">wicked fun bonfires</a> and <a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/pacific-northwest-news/2011/06/familys_near-death_experience_emphasizes_need_for_safety_at_oregon_coast.html">people being crushed under waterlogged logs weighing from hundreds of pounds to a couple of tons</a>. According to that article, it takes only four inches of water to float a five ton log. If that five ton log gets picked up by the ocean and dropped onto you, you are going to have a bad day.</p>

On Wildfires and Evacuations
</h2>

<p align="center">Picture of the houses across the street taken the morning of the wildfire evacuation.</p>
<p class="embiggen"><img src="oregon.wildfire.morning.png" width="90%" alt="Dark orange everything the morning of the evacuation." /></p>

<p>On Monday night - after having spent many wonderful hours barbecuing, drinking, and lazing the beautiful, sunny Labor Day holiday away - we went to bed. Unlike my partner in crime, I couldn't fall asleep right away, so I stayed up for a while and read. Around midnight, the power began flickering on and off intermittently, and by 1:30 in the morning the power had gone completely. When I turned in around three, the power was still out.</p>

<p>Despite the fun and exhausting Labor Day we'd both had, we woke up early on Tuesday to get a jump on the week. We glanced outside to see the sunrise. The fog off the ocean mixed with the early morning sun gave a delightful red-orange glow to the world. Gorgeous. Great way to start the work week. My better half went outside to take the trash to the curb. When she got back, she said, "That's not fog. It's smoke."</p>

<p>While I'd been reading in the early hours of the morning, I'd heard the wind pickup. Nothing like fresh ocean air and the sound of surf to help knock you out, so I opened a window. I'd occasionally smelled smoke on the breeze, in fact, I eventually shut the window because of it, but had just assumed the smoke was from one of the many bonfires that blaze on the beaches all summer long. There was a burn ban in effect for the entire county - rare at any time of the year, but even rarer during a summer weekend on the coast - tourists love them some bonfires so rarely paid attention to the bans, and city and county officials love them some tourists bucks so rarely enforced them.</p>

<p>"It's smoke," she'd said. I went outside. Sure enough: smoke. No biggie. We're used to being smoked out a couple of times a year from PNW and Canada fires. The wind was still blowing hard and the power was still out. No biggie. We're used to strong winds and power outages a couple of times a year. The wind was blowing from the east instead of the north or west like it usually did. No biggie. While rare, it just means we get higher temps - 70s or even 80s instead of 60s - from the warmer air blown over the coastal range from the valley. Since the smoke and the wind and the temperature was up, we made sure our windows were closed and our HVAC was off. We sat in our comfy chairs, turned on cellphone data, and tethered our laptops. We wondered which might die first, the cell towers or our laptop batteries.</p>

<p>After not more than a couple of minutes working, our phones blew up with chimes and beeps and vibrations: "Did you hear-" "Have you seen-" "The fire-" "Unbelievable-" We hadn't heard or seen, so we checked a few news sources and discovered, well, not only had we gone from beautiful and mild and cool last night to warm and windy and smoky, but we also had a thousand acre fire just a couple of miles away.</p>

<p>We're from the Midwest. Tornadoes are our natural disaster jam. We're used to the watches and warnings. We take them seriously but don't worry overly much about them. When we moved out here, not only did we have to worry about the occasional tornado, but we threw earthquakes, volcanoes, tsunamis, and wildfires into the natural disaster mix.</p>

<p>What were we thinking?</p>

<p>We monitored the official sites for information - city, county, and state websites; Facebook pages and Twitter accounts; radio. They all said the same thing: winds, high temps, and dry conditions were hampering containment efforts. All of Oregon's firefighting helicopters were deployed to Afghanistan. Fire crews were short on personnel given all the other wildfires going on. Outside, we heard the continuous warble, whoop, and waaaaah of emergency service sirens, dopplering their up and down Hwy 101.</p>

<p>The fire kept advanced.</p>

<p>Tuesday evening we started packing up some of our stuff, figuring out what we needed to take compared to what would actually fit in our car, a 2010 Ford Taurus. We charged up all of our devices (UPS - uninterruptable power supplies, something we'd gotten after the first couple of power outages) emergency back batteries)We That night we went to bed, the power was still out and the windows were still closed. When we woke up that second day, the fires - two fires actually, Echo Mountain Fire and Kimberly Mountain Fire - combined to form one fire: Echo Mountain Complex. Echo Mountain Complex had jumped the containment lines due to the still strong winds from the east and stupid dry conditions on the ground. About two thousand acres were burning. Strong east winds meant it was roaring our way. Dry conditions and lack of resources meant there was little be done about it.</p>
