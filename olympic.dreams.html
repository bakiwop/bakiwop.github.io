<h1 class="enorme">Olympic Dreams</h1>


<p>I have this recurring dream during the Olympics: I have a son, named Uri, who is a dearly beloved Olympian (the sport itself is unimportant, and it doesn't matter if he wins any medals - it's the public adoration aspect I focus on here) and his worldwide fan club, of which there are tens of millions of members, is called the Uri Nation. And his fans eagerly call themselves Uri Nators.</p>
