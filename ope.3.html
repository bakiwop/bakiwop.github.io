		<p>I wonder what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignaz_Semmelweis">Ignaz Semmelweis</a>, the physician in 1800s Hungary who was shunned, mocked, fired, beaten, suffered a nervous breakdown, and killed for suggesting healthcare workers should wash their hands to reduce postpartum mortalities that were three times higher than midwives (who did wash their hands), would think of this comic found in a doctor's examination room?</p>

		<p>My wife is very into hockey (she's from Minnesota, dontchaknow) and just told me this: <a href="https://apnews.com/article/wild-kirill-kaprizov-contract-df38df3d649600ff7d953da19ac8acbb">Minnesota Wild sign Kirill Kaprizov to richest deal in NHL history: $136 million over 8 years</a>.</p>
		<p>My first thought? I'm not sure I would trade 8 years of my life for $136 million.</p>
		<p>Which just goes to show what a dumbass I am.</p>
		<p>My instincts tell me to say no (and I don't seem to be paying attention to the more logical parts of my brain (which is, usually, par for the course)).</p>
		<p>Just colossal dumbassery on my part.</p>
		<p>But no matter which way I look at it, if my current job - and let me tell you I have a pretty plum gig - offered me $136 million to stay for eight more years? I'd say no.<sup>1</sup></p>
		<p>It just feels wrong.</p>
		<p>It doesn't matter that I would still be below retirement age at the end of the 8 year contract and could retire early. It doesn't matter that I would make roughly $136 million more dollars for 8 years of work than if I worked those same 8 years at my current (with step increases) salary. It doesn't matter that I would be <em>lucky</em> - oh so very lucky - to be able to keep my job for the next 8 years at all.</p>
		<p>None of that matters.</p>
		<p>What seems to matter? I don't know. But good for Kaprizov. He seems smarter than me. And richer. Younger. More athletic. Probably nicer. And? And my wife is very happy that he'll be playing for the Wild.</p>
		<br />
		<p><sup>1</sup>My wife, god bless her, would soon set me straight, though.</p>
