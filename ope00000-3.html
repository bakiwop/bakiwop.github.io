<a href="https://omls.oregon.gov/pipermail/libs-or/2023-March/020945.html">BIPOC Mental Health Trends and Disparities</a>
<br /><br />
With the Library 2.023: Mental Health and Wellness Conference(1) and the recent LJ article &quot;Working Toward Wellness: Exploring Trauma-Informed Librarianship&quot;(2) (featuring, in part, Oregon libraries' very own fabulous Bryce Kozla) it is important to bring up mental health awareness for our BIPOC colleagues (3)(4) .
<br /><br />
Non-BIPOC library staff absolutely need to be aware of the daily and lifetime traumas faced by our BIPOC colleagues, including those experienced in our library workplaces. We need to:
<br /><br />
A) Acknowledge white privilege. Don't believe in white privilege? Imagine all of the stuff you go through on a daily basis - all the struggles and joys and boredom - now imagine dealing with everything you deal with while also having to deal with everything from a greater chance of getting a jaywalking ticket(5) to dying more frequently during childbirth(6) to being incarcerated with greater frequency and duration(7) to being murdered while out for a jog(8) or driving(9) or sleeping in your own bed(10) to the extreme generational wealth gap(11). Your white privilege means not having to deal with any of that...ever...much less on a daily basis.
<br /><br />
B) Listen to our BIPOC colleagues. Listen without prejudice. Listen and believe despite your lack of experience in the matter. From the LJ article, &quot;In libraries, the main goal is to be anticipatory and move the discussion from 'What is wrong with you?' to 'What do you need?'&quot;
<br /><br />
C) Don't treat EDIA as a separate thing. It is not only a committee. It is not only a position in your organization. EDIA has to be fully integrated by everybody everyday in the workplace because that is the only way to combat the systemic injustice our BIPOC colleagues experience every day.
<br /><br />
Don't know where to start? Ask the OLA EDIA Committee(12), check out their Antiracism Toolkit(13), or the Western States Center&#8217;s Confronting White Nationalism in Libraries Toolkit(14).
<br /><br />
By the way, much of this also goes for our LGBTQIA+ colleagues. Imagine not being accepted for who you are. For state and federal legislators to try and pass laws (and at times succeeding) to make who you are illegal(15)? This is the trauma that our LGBTQIA+ colleagues face every day, and they have faced it for their entire lives.
<br /><br />
Frankly, it goes for every marginalized group of people who are made to be &quot;other.&quot; It isn't us vs them, it is all of us simply allowing people to be who they are.
<br /><br />
&quot;Love is an action, never simply a feeling.&quot;
&#8213; bell hooks
<br /><br />
Do something.

<a href="https://omls.oregon.gov/pipermail/libs-or/2023-March/020956.html">More on White Privilege</a>
<br /><br />
Yesterday I wrote a bit about what white privilege is, but it didn't cover all of what white privilege is. White privilege is not just not experiencing the disadvantages that BIPOC so often face. Peggy McIntosh explains in her article from 1989(1), &quot;As a white person, I realized I had been taught about racism as something which puts others at a disadvantage, but had been taught not to see one of its corollary aspects, white privilege, which puts me at an advantage.&quot;
<br /><br />
She explains how whiteness is the dominant culture in so many of our institutions and systems and how easily that meant she could navigate those systems, &quot;I see a pattern running through the matrix of white privilege, a pattern of assumptions which were passed on to me as a white person. There was one main piece of cultural turf; it was my own turf, and I was among those who could control the turf. My skin color was an asset for any move I was educated to want to make. I could think of myself as belonging in major ways, and of making social systems work for me. I could freely disparage, fear, neglect, or be oblivious to anything outside of the dominant cultural forms. Being of the main culture, I could also criticize it fairly freely.&quot;
<br /><br />
Finally, Peggy McIntosh lists 26 ways in which she experiences white privilege, then states, &quot;I repeatedly forgot each of the realizations on this list until I wrote it down. For me white privilege has turned out to be an elusive and fugitive subject. The  pressure to avoid it is great, for in facing it I must give up the myth of meritocracy. If these things are true, this is not such a free country; one&#8217;s life is not what one makes it; many doors open for certain people through no virtues of their own.&quot;
<br /><br />
You should read her list of 26 items from the article linked below and see how our libraries, and library organizations and associations promote white privilege and white supremacy...and how we benefit from that.

<br /><br />
Believe in white privilege and systemic racism? Love is doing something. Contact the wonderful people on the OLA EDIA committee(1), contact the groovy folk at the Unpacking Discussion Group(2), grab the nearest white person and start talking, and/or email me and start talking(3). DO NOT talk to your BIPOC friends or colleagues, they have enough without having to explain to another white person - yet again - what's going on. DO listen to your BIPOC friends and colleagues...actually listen...really listen...and learn.
<br /><br />
Don't believe in white privilege? Don't believe in systemic racism? Are(4) you(5) really(6) sure(7) about(8) that(9)? There(10) seem(11) to(12) be(13) a(14) lot(15) of(16) indicators(17) in(18) our(19)...ahhh(20)...system(21) that(22) point(23) to(24) huge(25) disparities(26) in(27) almost(28) every(29) aspect(30) of(31) American(32) life(33) that(34) would(35) seem(36) to(37) indicate(38) otherwise(39). Still(40) don't(41) believe(42)? I would really love to hear from you and learn why you (dis)believe what you do?(43) We can even go to personal emails so everything stays nice and confidential.
<br /><br />
Three days in a row y'all have put up with me, and I thank you for your patience. I'll be taking the weekend off. It's a three day weekend (woot!) for me. I hope yours is pleasant, and if you're working, I hope your #SaturdayLibrarian/#SundayLibrarian shift goes quickly and quietly.

...for the little white lie. I won't be taking the weekend off, although it is a wonderful example of my privilege that I have that choice.  Our BIPOC colleagues do not have that choice...no weekends off for them.

If you have the choice to neither think nor deal with racism, you have white privilege.

<a href="https://omls.oregon.gov/pipermail/libs-or/2023-March/020971.html">On the fifth day of white privilege...</a>
<br /><br />
...this old white guy said to me...
<br /><br />
Five days talking about white privilege. Five! Why? 1) When we acknowledge our white privilege we realize systemic oppression is real. 2) When we realize systemic oppression is real we're able to do something about it. 3) I'm an old white guy and it's what I'm familiar with.
<br /><br />
Let's...ahhh...just set aside #3 aside, shall we?
<br /><br />
Libraries are white spaces.(1) What happens when we don't acknowledge that libraries are white spaces? What happens when we don't acknowledge our white privilege?
<br /><br />
A very tragically common example of the failure of libraries at the national level: April Hathcock's abuse at and by ALA.(2)
<br /><br />
A more recent example of failure at the local level: What is happening to the OLA President.(3)
<br /><br />
Step 1 for white people? Believe. We have all the proof of systemic racism at every level, so when we hear it from our colleagues, be like Ted Lasso and Believe! I work at the same library Star works at, and without a doubt Star is one of the most amazing and tenacious librarians I know, and I've witnessed her experiencing so much racism in the seven years I've had the great privilege to work with her.
<br /><br />
That's why we need to acknowledge our white privilege. When we acknowledge it...talk about it...do something about it...we begin to help make our BIPOC colleagues' lives better.
<br /><br />
And that's why white people have to talk with each other about it - keep it in the front of our brains, at the top of our consciousness - because it's so easy for us to not see it...and it's so easy for us to ignore it...and it's so easy for us to contribute to systemic and individual racism.
<br /><br />
So talk! Communicate! Email! Text! Semaphore! Be like Margaret and show encouragement.(4) Be like Anna and share what what you learn and try to inspire others.(5) Be like Holly and share how you learn.(6)

<a href="https://omls.oregon.gov/pipermail/libs-or/2023-March/020993.html">When do we want it?</a>
<br /><br />
It's been eight days of posting about systemic racism now. 8! A couple of years ago, had somebody else done this, I would have been, &quot;Don't you think you're taking this a bit far? Maybe slow down a bit? Calm down. We'll get there.&quot;
<br /><br />
Wrong. We have to make the effort now. Why? The longer white people wait, the more death and pain there is.
<br /><br />
There's an extremely pertinent quote by James Baldwin, &quot;I was born here more than 60 years ago. I'm not going to live another 60 years. You always told me that it's going to take time. It&#8217;s taken my father&#8217;s time, my mother&#8217;s time, my uncle&#8217;s time, my brothers&#8217; and my sisters&#8217; time, my nieces and my nephew's time. How much time do you want for your progress?&quot;(1)
<br /><br />
There's also many relevant quotes from Dr. King in his Letter from Birmingham Jail(2):
<br /><br />
First, I must confess that over the last few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate...who paternalistically feels that he can set the timetable for another man's freedom; who lives by the myth of time; and who constantly advises the Negro to wait until a &quot;more convenient season.&quot;
<br /><br />
&quot;For years now I have heard the word 'wait.' It rings in the ear of every Negro with a piercing familiarity. This 'wait' has almost always meant 'never' ... We must come to see with the distinguished jurist of yesterday that 'justice too long delayed is justice denied.' We have waited for more than three hundred and forty years for our God-given and constitutional rights ... I guess it is easy for those who have never felt the stinging darts of segregation to say 'wait.&quot;
<br /><br />
&quot;Frankly, I have never yet engaged in a direct-action movement that was 'well timed' according to the timetable of those who have not suffered unduly from the disease of segregation.&quot;
<br /><br />
&quot;When you are harried by day and haunted by night by the fact that you are a Negro, living constantly at tiptoe stance, never knowing what to expect next, and plagued with inner fears and outer resentments; when you are forever fighting a degenerating sense of 'nobodyness' -- then you will understand why we find it difficult to wait. There comes a time when the cup of endurance runs over and men are no longer willing to be plunged into an abyss of injustice where they experience the bleakness of corroding despair. I hope, sirs, you can understand our legitimate and unavoidable impatience.
<br /><br />
&quot;I had also hoped that the white moderate would reject the myth of time. I received a letter this morning from a white brother in Texas which said, 'All Christians know that the colored people will receive equal rights eventually, but is it possible that you are in too great of a religious hurry? It has taken Christianity almost 2000 years to accomplish what it has. The teachings of Christ take time to come to earth.' All that is said here grows out of a tragic misconception of time. It is the strangely irrational notion that there is something in the very flow of time that will inevitably cure all ills. Actually, time is neutral. It can be used either destructively or constructively. I am coming to feel that the people of ill will have used time much more effectively than the people of good will. &quot;

<br /><br />
You and I are the greatest barrier to ending racism. Not members of the KKK. Not members of the Proud Boys. You and me...just average everyday white folk.
<br /><br />
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. knew it.(1) Reni Eddo-Lodge knows it(2)...like, painfully knows it.(3) Rachel Cargle knows it.(4) James Baldwin knew it.(5)(6) Ta-Nehisi Coates knows it.(7) Leonard Pitts knows it.(8) Lorraine Hansberry knew it.(9) Sam Reason knows it.(10) Maya Angelou knew it.(11) Cristina Garc&#168;&#170;a knows it.(12) Roxane Gay knows it.(13)
<br /><br />
Now we know it, too.
<br /><br />
Love is doing something about it.

<br /><br />
1 - &quot;I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in the stride toward freedom is not the White Citizens Councillor or the Ku Klux Klanner but the white moderate who is more devoted to order than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says, 'I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I can't agree with your methods of direct action.'&quot;

<br /><br />
2 - &quot;I can no longer have this conversation, because we're often coming at it from completely different places. I can't have a conversation with them about the details of a problem if they don't even recognise that the problem exists. Worse still is the white person who might be willing to entertain the possibility of said racism, but who thinks we enter this conversation as equals. We don't.&quot;

<br /><br />
3 - &quot;Amid every conversation about Nice White People feeling silenced by conversations about race, there is a sort of ironic and glaring lack of understanding or empathy for those of us who have been visibly marked out as different for our entire lives, and live the consequences. It's truly a lifetime of self-censorship that people of colour have to live. The options are: speak your truth and face the reprisals, or bite your tongue and get ahead in life. It must be a strange life, always having permission to speak and feeling indignant when you're finally asked to listen. It stems from white people's never-questioned entitlement, I suppose.&quot;

<br /><br />
6 -  &quot;...and this is the crime of which I accuse my country and my countrymen, and for which neither I nor time nor history will ever forgive them, that they have destroyed and are destroying hundreds of thousands of lives and do not know it and do not want to know it. ... But it is not permissible that the authors of devastation should also be innocent. It is the innocence which constitutes the crime.&quot;

<br /><br />
7 - &quot;And no one would be brought to account for this destruction, because my death would not be the fault of any human but the fault of some unfortunate but immutable fact of 'race,' imposed upon an innocent country by the inscrutable judgment of invisible gods. The earthquake cannot be subpoenaed. The typhoon will not bend under indictment.&quot;

8 - &quot;So often in today's culture, Americans will affix 'personal responsibility' on minorities to defend or deflect blame for prejudicial and, at times, deadly treatment. There is almost never an acknowledgement from a majority of white Americans that racism remains a very real threat to minorities.

10 - &quot;If someone&#161;&#175;s blatantly racist, you know their agenda, their motive, and you know exactly what they&#161;&#175;re saying and why they&#161;&#175;re saying it. But when people make subtle racist comments, they often don&#161;&#175;t believe or realize they&#161;&#175;re being racist and maybe don&#161;&#175;t mean it. So, if you challenge them, they&#161;&#175;ll often be defensive, 'I&#161;&#175;m not harming anybody, it&#161;&#175;s only a joke'. Or, they may think I&#161;&#175;m being over-sensitive. But imagine if you were on the receiving end of that joke? How would you feel?&quot;

11 - &quot;Many members of that early band of twentieth-century pilgrims must have yearned for the honesty of Southern landscapes where even if they were the targets of hate mongers who wanted them dead, they were at least credited with being alive. Northern whites with their public smiles of liberal acceptance and their private behavior of utter rejection wearied and angered the immigrants.&quot;

12 - &quot;There are white people who know how to act politely to blacks, but deep  down you know they're uncomfortable. They're worse, more dangerous than those who speak their minds, because they don't know what they're  capable of.&quot;

13 - &quot;There is no collective slavery revenge fantasy among black people but I  am certain, if there were one, it would not be about white people, not at all. My slavery revenge fantasy would probably involve being able to  read and write without fear of punishment or persecution or a long  vacation in Paris. It would involve the reclamation of dignity on my own  terms and not with the 'generous' assistance of benevolent white people  who were equally complicit in the ills of slavery.&quot;
