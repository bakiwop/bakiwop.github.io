the ex-clown told the world her story, which became known as "God's Circus" & was given as proof that god's chosen are humans, not clowns.

then, lightning struck each clown. giant floppy shoes flew off clown feet & red noses gave a final, pathetic honk. clown denouement.
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

the clowns, seeing her now as human, performed - for no clown can help but perform around humans. as the storm raged they threw cream pies.
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

save one young clown who stood her ground, stared up into the storm & cried, Human! as her baggy pants & oversized shoes filled with water.

it was a heck of a battle, but the f-16s didn't have a prayer against Santa & his 9 magic reindeer.
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

i peaked over the edge of the sleigh - past Santa, past Rudolph's red nose - & saw hope in the form of a dozen f-16s. i got down right quick
<br /><br />

during my abduction a couple of days ago i got a text message from Special Agent Williams reading, "jet fghtrs cming now - get down!"

...when outside the window i heard such a clatter, i ran across the room to see what was the matter...
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

...people stormed in, running & screaming up the 12 flights of stairs to my room. they kicked & clawed at my door, which exploded open...

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

ok...ok...not sure how much time i have here...about an hour ago i looked out the window and saw Santa kick in the door to the Parmelia...

day 2 stuck in the hotel room. the mob outside has swelled to over 100,000 people, the night made bright with 100's of burning effigies...

...i wish I cold say the same for me - i'm surrounded by 30,000 protesters, crazed elves, mad sugar plum fairies and the big man himself.

<h1>Feb 2010</h1>
<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

so the circus clowns & the rodeo clowns made peace, but as they left the bar they saw the childrens party clowns lurking in the shadows. fin
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

the circus clowns hesitated - rodeo clowns were their sworn whiteface enemies & yet they were trying to help a brother out. clown quandary.
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

the rodeo clowns leapt into action trying to distract the mechanical bull & save the fallen circus clown. rodeo clowns are brave, not smart.
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

as the rodeo clowns raised their hankies to attack, the circus clown riding the mechanical bull fell off & landed on a squirting flower.
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

a circus clown dropped & stepped on its whoopee cushion, breaking the spell of the mechanical bull riding circus clown for the rodeo clowns.







<h1>Jan 2010</h1>
<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

a circus clown hopped onto the bar's mechanical bull - the rodeo clowns couldn't help but watch. the circus clowns crept up behind them.
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

while fighting, a rodeo clown deftly repainted a circus clown's happy face to a sad one making the circus clown slump on a bar stool & sulk.
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

a circus clown sprayed a bottle of seltzer wildly, hitting friend & foe alike; a panicked circus clown is nobody's ally (save laughter's).
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

another circus clown tried to make a balloon animal bull to scare the rodeo clowns with, but in haste, made a giraffe instead. big mistake.
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

a rodeo clown threw the 1st punch, the fist landing squishingly on a circus clown's red nose with an AOOGA! before bouncing off harmlessly.
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

the rodeo clowns emerged from their barrels - with their sneakers they were confident they could outmaneuver their floppy-shoed adversaries.
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

seeing the rodeo clowns' hankies, the circus clowns dropped their kazoos & grabbed their own hankies from ears, noses & mouths. it was on.
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

the rodeo clowns dove into barrels for cover, slowly peeking over the edges, adjusting cowboy hats & brandishing hankies for the onslaught.
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

as the circus clowns burst through the bar's door they whistled Ennio Morricone's "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" theme on their kazoos.
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

the circus clowns tumbled out of their miniature car & flopped, in their big-shoed way, toward the rodeo clown bar. time for a reckoning.

<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

a brief summer rain washed off the whiteface makeup revealing his true, sad face. the kids now cried when he handed them balloon animals.

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

...while at the same time hoping that the ex- vampire hunter/customer would finish him off and not, instead, make him a vampire as well...
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

...because really, who wants to hear a vampire going around saying things like, "i gots the mad undead skillz, yo!" before being killed ...
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

...honestly, just kill me please, ex-purveyor-of-fake-holy-water, and save me the bad gangsta-wannabe lingo...
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

...to which the undead ex-purveyor-of-fake-holy-water vampire would respond, "what da hell is 'ingo yo? is dat da thing dat ate dat baby?"..
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

...& then you'd be stuck explaining what 'lingo' meant to a vampire with the IQ of a jellyfish when he was just going to kill you anyway...
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

...& by the time you were done explaining it to him you'd really want the eternal embrace of death because he was THAT annoying...
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

...& then you'd be stuck with him for all eternity, hearing him say things like, "dag yo! playa had some mad blood up in dem veins!"...
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

...until one day, far in the annoying future, you'd realize that you just couldn't deal with him anymore and would contemplate suicide...
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

...but would initially despair because you were already dead - well, undead - and darned near immortal and thus pretty hard to kill, yo...
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

...& when you thought 'yo' you would redouble your efforts toward ending it all because you'd realize you were starting to speak like him...
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

...just as you were starting to drive the stake through your heart you'd be so pissed that he'd live while you died & then it hit you....
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

...you could end it all for yourself by killing him because he was your maker - every vampire he made would die if you killed him...
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

...you'd met many of the other vampires he'd made, they were just like him, saying "yo!" and "tru dat!" you'd be doing the world a favor...
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

...so that very night, with much glee & a light heart, you staked the annoying undead ex-purveyor-of-fake-holy-water vampire in the heart...
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

...as he turned to dust in front of you he blinked back a single blood tear and said, "bitchez!"...
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

...which made you feel bad for a moment until, from all around the earth, you heard thousands of undead scream, "bitchez!" before dying...
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

...then you'd wonder why you hadn't turned to dust with your maker & why you no longer craved blood or could turn into a vampire bat...
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

...you'd wander around for a while & then watch your 1st sunrise in over 100 years. you'd realize that god was pleased with your work...
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

...after the beautiful sunrise you'd slowly rise toward heaven and god would say to you, "mad propz on killing dat annoying vampire, yo!"...
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

...& then perhaps after hearing his silly speech you wouldn't feel so bad about him being killed by an undead ex- vampire hunter/customer...
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

...to which he would respond, "yo!" (because that's how he spoke) "have you seen the mad prices the priests are charging to bless da h20"...
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

...so why, might you ask, didn't he just go legit in the vampire hunter world & sell real holy water to vampire hunters in the 1st place...
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

...which would, you know, suck (both literally and figuratively) for him....
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

...and then, since he sold fake holy water, he wouldn't be able to protect himself against the undead ex- vampire hunter/customer...
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

...although the killed vampire hunter could potentially come back as an undead ex-vampire hunter and kill him for selling fake holy water...







<h1>Sep 2009</h1>
<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

...& if the vampire hunter used the fake holy water against a real vampire then they would most assuredly die & not be able to sue him ...
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

...and everyone - the vampire hunter & the "vampire" - could go home happy without the knowledge it wasn't real holy water he'd sold them...
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

...& if the vampire hunter used the fake holy water against a vampire they were chasing & lived then it wasn't a real vampire...
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

he sold fake holy water for $7/bottle figuring those who used it & lived didn't really need it & those who used it & died couldn't sue him.
<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />

because, you know, he was selling the holy water to vampire hunters...
<br /><br />

<br /><br />

<br /><br />

<span class="blue">@bakiwop</span><br />
