So! I figure I should try the New Year's wish thing. Resolutions just mean more work for me and wishing for things like world peace never really pan out, so just give me oodles of dough. Absurd amounts of bucks. It's not even like I want a <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/jeff-bezos-500m-yacht-has-a-246-foot-support-ship-lauren-sanchez-figurehead/ar-AA1brJ4a">second yacht to support my first yacht</a>, a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/dec/21/mark-zuckerberg-apocalypse-bunker-hawaii">bunker fancier than Zuckerberg's</a>, or a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/18/former-ge-ceo-jeff-immelt-used-two-jets-for-business-travel-wsj.html">second private jet to follow around my first private jet</a>. I'd just like to have more money than I know what to do with. The ability to pay for things and buy my way out of any trouble without having to think about it. Not have to put in a forty hour work week...and my job? My job is pretty darned cushy. I get paid a good amount of money to help people every day. It's a plum gig. But I'd still rather not have to spend 40+ hours of my week doing it.
