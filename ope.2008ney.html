Her new liver's blood stem cells then invaded her body's bone marrow to take over her entire immune system, meaning the teen no longer needs anti-rejection drugs."</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A Spanish driver who collided with a cyclist is suing the dead youth's family for $29,300 for the damage the impact of his body did to his luxury car. The youth's family won 33,000 euros compensation from Delgado's insurance company after the firm acknowledged he had been driving at excessive speed and this could have contributed to the incident, El Pais reported. "I'm also a victim in all of this, you can't fix the lad's problems, but you can fix mine," Delgado told the newspaper, ahead of a January 30 legal decision on his suit."</blockquote>

<blockquote>
The Coolidge Effect is a phenomenon whereby males exhibit high sexual performance given the introduction of new willing females.
 <br /><br />
    It earned its name many years ago when President Coolidge and his wife were touring a farm. While the President was elsewhere, the farmer proudly showed Mrs. Coolidge a rooster that "could copulate with hens all day long, day after day." Mrs. Coolidge coyly suggested that the farmer tell that to Mr. Coolidge, which he did.
 <br /><Br />

    The President thought for a moment and then inquired, "With the same hen?"
 <br /><br />
    "No, sir," replied the farmer.
 <br /><br />
    "Tell that to Mrs. Coolidge," retorted the President.

And older children say that they want to be friends with someone who speaks in their native accent.' Accents and vernacular, far more than race, seem to influence the people we like.
