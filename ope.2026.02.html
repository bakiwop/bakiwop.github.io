<p>Finally got around to (beginning) to take care of <a href="ope.2025.12.html#12">that tree</a>. Great googamooga! Wood is hard!</p>
<p>First cut. Just to the left of the upright tree in the middle in <a href="ope.2025.12.html#12">the pic</a>. Started off with a chainsaw. Neither Stacy nor I had ever used one before. We got it stuck after getting 3/4 of the way through. Got it unstuck. Tried again. Got it stuck. Couldn't get it unstuck. For the rest of the first cut we were used a 1.25 pound single bit ax and a metal claw hammer. Et voilà!</p>
<p class="embiggen">
	<img src="media/tree.down.1.png" alt="Stacy being hidden by the branches of the tree. Taken from the cracked eight foot tall base." title="Big tree." />
</p>
<p>Second cut was where the tree's trunk broke. It's about eight feet up there. Could just barely reach it with the chainsaw. I'm sure the form I was using broke some chainsaw rules of etiquette. Paul Bunyan would've been so disappointed. Chainsaw worked again for a bit then stopped. Couldn't get it going. Used the 1.25 pound ax a bit. then, while Stacy tried to fix the chainsaw, I decided to rock the trunk back and forth vigorously over and over and over again until it finally dropped. Yay!</p>
<p>Third cut. Just to the right of the upright tree in the middle from <a href="ope.2025.12.html#12">the pic</a>. We couldn't get the chainsaw working. Thought we'd give the ax and the hammer a bit of a workout. When one of us was too tired to continue the other would jump in and give 'er. After about an hour we got through it. Yippee!</p>
<p class="embiggen">
	<img src="media/tree.down.2.png" alt="Tree from the house." title="Tree in three." />
</p>
<p>Still have to trim the branches and move the small(ish) middle section we cut. Hopefully the chainsaw will work today. If not? Axes and claw hammers it is. Also if not? We owe the guy we borrowed it from $450 to replace it. Drat.</p>
<p>No deer offered to help. Lazy bastards.</p>
<p>Two takeaways. 1) That little ax is a humdinger. I can't wait to get it resharpened and chop something else. 2) Sawdust, like sand, gets <cite>everywhere</cite>.</p>

<p>Previous business: the ax we used on <a href="ope.2026.02.html#36">the tree</a> was actually a hatchet...<a href="https://www.acehardware.com/departments/tools/hand-tools/hatchets/2194769
">this hatchet</a>. So much fun!</p>
<p>We've been watching the Olympics. Also so much fun! Get the entire world together and celebrate the pinnacle of human physical achievement! When Stacy and I started dating we both worked second shift. We'd finish up, hang out at <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Barnes+%26+Noble/@45.0035649,-93.1647971,17z/data=!3m1!5s0x52b32bf6324d27ff:0xee8bb6a1e6864b9b!4m14!1m7!3m6!1s0x52b32b971afc2f09:0x251211adf8811cbc!2sBarnes+%26+Noble!8m2!3d45.0040185!4d-93.1647928!16s%2Fg%2F1tgp0fts!3m5!1s0x52b32b971afc2f09:0x251211adf8811cbc!8m2!3d45.0040185!4d-93.1647928!16s%2Fg%2F1tgp0fts">Barnes & Noble</a> until it closed, go for a walk around <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=twin+cities+lakes">one of the lakes</a>, get home, make dinner, and watch the Olympics.</p>
<p>Good times.</p>
<p>It's nice to remember the good times, but while it may have been good times for us, it wasn't good times for a lot of people.</p>
<p>Which, when it comes down to it, seems to be the human condition.</p>
<p>For instance: the IOC. Yay putting on the Olympics, but? The <a href="https://www.olympics.com/ioc">IOC</a> sucks. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Olympic_Games_scandals,_controversies_and_incidents">1</a>)(<a href="https://law-richmond.libguides.com/c.php?g=388993&p=2639263">2</a>)(<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=ioc+corruption+">3</a>)</p>
<p>And it isn't just the IOC with the Olympics. Cities do uncool things to get and put on the Olympics. (<a href="https://daily.jstor.org/how-olympics-host-citie-hide-their-homeless/">1</a>)(<a href="https://endhomelessness.org/blog/hiding-a-citys-homelessness-crisis-through-displacement-what-the-olympics-remind-us-about-harmful-practices/">2</a>)(<a href="https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/when-los-angeles-host-2028-olympics-visitors-may-be-greeted-by-tens-of-thousands-of-homeless-people/3483400/">3</a>)</p>
<p>And it isn't just the Olympics. <a href="https://www.fifa.com">FIFA</a> sucks. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:FIFA_controversies">1</a>)(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegations_of_corruption_and_bribery_related_to_the_2022_FIFA_World_Cup">2</a>)(<a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/05/chart-fifa-deaths-qatar-move-it-to-the-united-states/">3</a>)</p>
<p>Frankly, it seems like most every <a href="https://www.propublica.org/series/supreme-court-scotus">powerful</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_federal_political_scandals_in_the_United_Stateshttps">governing institution</a> has <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/misconduct">its problems</a>.</p>
<p><a href="ope.2025.07.html#12">And has had for a long time.</a></p>
<p>But back to the Olympics. We get this great spectacle, and it's so wonderful, but there's this dark side to it - graft, and death, and unconscionable acts and we ignore it all for our own good time.</p>
<p>Which says a lot about us.</p>
