		<p>Went for <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Lincoln+City,+OR/Timber,+OR/45.9020833,-123.7602406/45.709299,-123.8578095/45.6651582,-123.8380518/Lincoln+City,+OR/@45.5534159,-123.6441659,10.31z/data=!4m33!4m32!1m10!1m1!1s0x54ea8d760b76bd77:0x71530e6a7d2ce862!2m2!1d-124.0159354!2d44.9620902!3m4!1m2!1d-123.8298783!2d45.4569653!3s0x54eb2b0819a53bef:0x72022cb2003593a5!1m5!1m1!1s0x5494e5a1524ec1e1:0x1df48d08327d929d!2m2!1d-123.2955437!2d45.7198097!1m0!1m0!1m5!3m4!1m2!1d-123.9322534!2d45.4082587!3s0x54eb28578f2bd465:0xcc7a01aa247653ae!1m5!1m1!1s0x54ea8d760b76bd77:0x71530e6a7d2ce862!2m2!1d-124.0159354!2d44.9620902!3e0?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDgwNi4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D">a 200 mile ride</a> today - up 101, over the Coastal Range, up through the Coastal Range, back over the Coastal Range, then down the coast to home. Lots of fun riding and pretty scenery.</p>
		<p>Up over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_Route_6">Oregon Route 6</a> is one of my favorite rides over the Coastal Range. Well, I lie a little here, they're all my favorite, but they're all favorites for different reasons. Hwy 6 is my favorite because I can hustle through the twists and uneven roads better than most anything on four wheels, so when I ride it on a weekend during the summer with all the tourists heading to and from the coast there's lots of passing to be had.</p>
		<p>Vroom.</p>
		<p>Today I caught up to a loaded down (lots of luggage on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pillion">pillion seat</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sissy_bar">sissy bar</a>)<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softail">Harley Softail</a> (not sure which). Woo! They were hustling that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruiser_(motorcycle)">cruiser</a> through the curves and around cars like nobody's business.</p>
		<p>I used to have a <a href="https://www.bing.com/search?q=victory+boardwalk">Victory Boardwalk</a>, so I have an appreciation for how they were handling their bike.</p>
		<p>I was enjoying their riding so much I tucked in behind them and watched the show. They'd stand (must've had <a href="https://www.bing.com/search?q=motorcycle+mid+controls">mid-controls</a>, not <a href="https://www.bing.com/search?q=motorcycle+forward+controls">forwards</a>) over the worst of the uneven broken pavement and around curves without slowing; all the more impressive knowing they must've had only three(ish) inches of suspension travel (to my eight). And their <a href="https://www.bing.com/search?q=motorcycle+lean+angle">lean angle</a>? On a Harley like that? Almost nonexistent, and it slowed them down very little.</p>
		<p>Eventually I had to get off 6 to continue my little trip. I caught up with them, threw a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaka_sign">shaka</a>, and went on my way.</p>
		<p>And <a href="serial.10.html#93">Mabel</a>? Continues to impress. Oodles of ground clearance. Gobs of lean angle. Cruises around politely and hustles with a flick of the throttle.</p>

		<p>Sunday 10 August 2025</p>
		<p>Miles riding: 372. Especially nice ride <a href="serial.14.html#118">yesterday</a>.</p>
		<p>Hours writing: 0. Drat. Though I did find an old piece I'd been looking for for years: <a href="twas.the.night.before.christmas.html">'Twas the Night Before Christmas</a>. It's a little on the mean side of things but I really enjoy it. Glad I finally found it.</p>
		<p>Notable patron interactions:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Patron request: combustion libraries. Patron wanted in-state libraries with non-digital primary sources going back a few hundred years. Found options at the <a href="https://www.cookchemlab.com/">University of Oregon</a> and <a href="https://research.engr.oregonstate.edu/blunckgroup/combustion-ignition-radiation-and-energy-laboratory">Oregon State University</a>.</li>
			<li>Middle-school aged patron looking for some specific books went from being so shy around me they could barely speak to joking around with me and calling me Matthew.</li>
			<li>Got another hug. I'm averaging one per week lately.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>During online searches I've been using <a href="https://bing.com">Bing</a> more than <a href="https://google.com">Google</a> lately. The results are better and Google has taken to ignoring basic search parameters (-, "", etc). This has been happening more and more lately.
		<p>More work on <a href="archivio.antico.html">archivio.antico</a>: <a href="archivio.antico.herbie.2001/index.html">Herbie</a>, <a href="archivio.antico.election.2004/index.html">Election 2004</a>, and <a href="archivio.antico.rutabaga.v2.2002/index.html">Rutabaga v2</a>.</p>
		<p>Decided against moving for now. No Boise and no Flagstaff for us. We have a pretty good life and trying to make it even better by moving to a new place is too much of a gamble. Big risk for minimal gains. We'll continue taking day and weekend trips. We might still move back to the Twin Cities, though, should I ever get a job offer there.</p>
		<p>Decided against embedding offsite media (think youtube vids and the like). Much better privacy-wise. Went through and changed all old embeds with links. Still occasionally embed local media.</p>
		<p>Father memory: Letting me steer the car (from the passenger seat (when I was in grade school)) after swim practice at the high school.</p>
		<p>Snowflake memory: using my suitcase as a bed so often I had to get a second suitcase.</p>

		<p>They really are the same, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)">two</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)">parties</a>.</p>
		<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alligator_Alcatraz">Republicans made internment camps.</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internment_of_Japanese_Americans">So did Democrats.</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trail_of_Tears">More than once.</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guantanamo_Bay_detention_camp">Sometimes they did it together.</a></p>
		<p>Republicans made the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriot_Act">USA Patriot Act</a> (Bush). Democrats expanded and codified it under the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Freedom_Act">US Freedom Act</a> (Obama). Both Bush and Obama greatly increased domestic surveillance and consolidated power in the executive branch.</p>
		<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171124135434/http:/jampac.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/042517cw2.pdf">The DNC stated, in a court of law, that they are not beholden to voters</a>, "and we could have voluntarily decided that, Look, we're gonna go into back rooms like they used to and smoke cigars and pick the candidate that way. That's not the way it was done. But they could have."</p>
		<p>Both Democrat- and Republican-led cities where police murder people (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Floyd">George Floyd</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_Justine_Damond">Justine Diamond</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breonna_Taylor">Breonna Taylor</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Daniel_Shaver">Daniel Shaver</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_Philando_Castile">Philando Castile</a> to mention a very very very few) with no change made to police departments.</p>
		<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuskegee_Syphilis_Study">Tuskegee Syphilis Study</a> from 1932 to 1972 - decades of Republicans and Democrats in power.</p>
		<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Stats_involvement_in_regime_change">coups</a> we instigated and <a href="https://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2013/08/23/honor-treaties-un-human-rights-chiefs-message-150996">treaties</a> we broke over the centuries for oil and bananas and oil and rubber and oil and land and oil? Republicans and Democrats.</p>
		<p>For the most part, the people we elect <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lATVIOXThDY&t=231s">don't</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yTrAZsFApI">respect</a> us, we're just <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/gov-walz-calls-state-employees-214937518.html">labor</a> for <a href="https://kstp.com/kstp-news/top-news/walz-wont-back-down-from-back-to-the-office-order/">their</a> economic engines.</p>
		<p>Voting for either party over the years has gotten us exactly where we are today.</p>
