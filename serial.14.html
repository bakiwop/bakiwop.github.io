		<p>Went for <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Lincoln+City,+OR/Timber,+OR/45.9020833,-123.7602406/45.709299,-123.8578095/45.6651582,-123.8380518/Lincoln+City,+OR/@45.5534159,-123.6441659,10.31z/data=!4m33!4m32!1m10!1m1!1s0x54ea8d760b76bd77:0x71530e6a7d2ce862!2m2!1d-124.0159354!2d44.9620902!3m4!1m2!1d-123.8298783!2d45.4569653!3s0x54eb2b0819a53bef:0x72022cb2003593a5!1m5!1m1!1s0x5494e5a1524ec1e1:0x1df48d08327d929d!2m2!1d-123.2955437!2d45.7198097!1m0!1m0!1m5!3m4!1m2!1d-123.9322534!2d45.4082587!3s0x54eb28578f2bd465:0xcc7a01aa247653ae!1m5!1m1!1s0x54ea8d760b76bd77:0x71530e6a7d2ce862!2m2!1d-124.0159354!2d44.9620902!3e0?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDgwNi4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D">a 200 mile ride</a> today - up 101, over the Coastal Range, up through the Coastal Range, back over the Coastal Range, then down the coast to home. Lots of fun riding and pretty scenery.</p>
		<p>Up over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_Route_6">Oregon Route 6</a> is one of my favorite rides over the Coastal Range. Well, I lie a little here, they're all my favorite, but they're all favorites for different reasons. Hwy 6 is my favorite because I can hustle through the twists and uneven roads better than most anything on four wheels, so when I ride it on a weekend during the summer with all the tourists heading to and from the coast there's lots of passing to be had.</p>
		<p>Vroom.</p>
		<p>Today I caught up to a loaded down (lots of luggage on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pillion">pillion seat</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sissy_bar">sissy bar</a>)<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softail">Harley Softail</a> (not sure which). Woo! They were hustling that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruiser_(motorcycle)">cruiser</a> through the curves and around cars like nobody's business.</p>
		<p>I used to have a <a href="https://www.bing.com/search?q=victory+boardwalk">Victory Boardwalk</a>, so I have an appreciation for how they were handling their bike.</p>
		<p>I was enjoying their riding so much I tucked in behind them and watched the show. They'd stand (must've had <a href="https://www.bing.com/search?q=motorcycle+mid+controls">mid-controls</a>, not <a href="https://www.bing.com/search?q=motorcycle+forward+controls">forwards</a>) over the worst of the uneven broken pavement and around curves without slowing; all the more impressive knowing they must've had only three(ish) inches of suspension travel (to my eight). And their <a href="https://www.bing.com/search?q=motorcycle+lean+angle">lean angle</a>? On a Harley like that? Almost nonexistent, and it slowed them down very little.</p>
		<p>Eventually I had to get off 6 to continue my little trip. I caught up with them, threw a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaka_sign">shaka</a>, and went on my way.</p>
		<p>And <a href="serial.10.html#93">Mabel</a>? Continues to impress. Oodles of ground clearance. Gobs of lean angle. Cruises around politely and hustles with a flick of the throttle.</p>

		<p>Sunday 10 August 2025</p>
		<p>Miles riding: 372. Especially nice ride <a href="serial.14.html#118">yesterday</a>.</p>
		<p>Hours writing: 0. Drat. Though I did find an old piece I'd been looking for for years: <a href="twas.the.night.before.christmas.html">'Twas the Night Before Christmas</a>. It's a little on the mean side of things but I really enjoy it. Glad I finally found it.</p>
		<p>Notable patron interactions:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Patron request: combustion libraries. Patron wanted in-state libraries with non-digital primary sources going back a few hundred years. Found options at the <a href="https://www.cookchemlab.com/">University of Oregon</a> and <a href="https://research.engr.oregonstate.edu/blunckgroup/combustion-ignition-radiation-and-energy-laboratory">Oregon State University</a>.</li>
			<li>Middle-school aged patron looking for some specific books went from being so shy around me they could barely speak to joking around with me and calling me Matthew.</li>
			<li>Got another hug. I'm averaging one per week lately.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>During online searches I've been using <a href="https://bing.com">Bing</a> more than <a href="https://google.com">Google</a> lately. The results are better and Google has taken to ignoring basic search parameters (-, "", etc). This has been happening more and more lately.
		<p>More work on <a href="archivio.antico.html">archivio.antico</a>: <a href="archivio.antico.herbie/index.html">Herbie</a>, <a href="archivio.antico.election.2004/index.html">Election 2004</a>, and <a href="archivio.antico.rutabaga.v2/index.html">Rutabaga v2</a>.</p>
		<p>Decided against moving for now. No Boise and no Flagstaff for us. We have a pretty good life and trying to make it even better by moving to a new place is too much of a gamble. Big risk for minimal gains. We'll continue taking day and weekend trips. We might still move back to the Twin Cities, though, should I ever get a job offer there.</p>
		<p>Decided against embedding offsite media (think youtube vids and the like). Much better privacy-wise. Went through and changed all old embeds with links. Still occasionally embed local media.</p>
		<p>Father memory: Letting me steer the car (from the passenger seat (when I was in grade school)) after swim practice at the high school.</p>
		<p>Snowflake memory: using my suitcase as a bed so often I had to get a second suitcase.</p>
