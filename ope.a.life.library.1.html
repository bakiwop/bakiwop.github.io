<p>Two enormous HVAC units sit on pallets outside the library. They'll be installed on the roof tomorrow. Two maintenance workers roll a large cart filled with HVAC parts around the library, looking for a place to stash it for tomorrow's installation.</p>
<p>"Why don't we just put it in there?" asks the first maintenance worker, nodding toward the study rooms. "We'll ask if it's okay."</p>
<p>The second maintenenace worker glances at the study room and hesitates.</p>
<p>The first maintenance worker asks, "Afraid it'll be stolen?"</p>
<p>The second maintenance worker looks to the first maintenance worker and says, "I'm afraid someone will pee on it or something."</p>

<p><a href="https://www.chron.com/news/article/texas-book-ban-butts-19501906.php">Texas library must reinstate books with 'butts and farts,' court says</a></p>
<blockquote>
	<p>The case itself originated from parent complaints that books in the Llano County public library system showed "butts and farts," prompting local officials to instruct the library director to take the books off shelves. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
	<p>Seven library patrons sued to reinstate the books, claiming the censorship violated the First Amendment. After a district court sided with the patrons and Llano residents appealed, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld an injunction to reinstate the offending titles, ordering the books should return to shelves within 24 hours.</p>
	<p>"Librarians may consider books’ contents in making curation decisions," judges ruled. "Their discretion, however, must be balanced against patrons’ First Amendment rights... a book may not be removed for the sole—or a substantial— reason that the decisionmaker does not wish patrons to be able to access the book’s viewpoint or message."</p>
</blockquote>
