				You’ll hear many politicians talk about change and how the change they want is better than the change their opponents want even though change is what the last person to get into office was talking about to get elected and we all know how that change turned out.
				<br /><br />
				So I want you to take a deep look into your own heart and see what kind of change you expect from a leader.  I want you to make sure that you want change, and once changed, the change is the kind of change you want because once a change is made changing back to the previous change is difficult at best and impossible at worst.
				<br /><br />
				So I guess what you have to ask yourself is if change is really what you want or do you want a change in the change being called for from my opponents.  Because their change is all about change but it is the type of change we’ve had in Washington for decades and that kind of change simply isn’t changing the face of politics enough.
				<br /><br />
				So we all agree we want change but my change is the kind of change we need because my change has changed from my opponents' (and the previous administrations’) change and will change things not just because it is change or because of change for the sake of change but rather because of the true change we need – the change of the status quo and other appropriate Latin terms.
				<br /><br />
				Since my change changes the change being called for from my opponents and previous administrations I can assure you that the change will change the change that is being changed from all the people trying to change.
				<br /><br />
				Believe in change because with belief in change there can be belief and change which will bring about change which will cause belief which facilitates change.  Believe!  Change!
				<br /><br />
				- Vote often, vote bakiwop!
