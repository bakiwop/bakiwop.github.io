				When faced with impossible odds, generations of Americans have responded with a simple creed that sums up the spirit of a people:
				<br /><br />
				Get more money.
				<br /><br />
				People need flat screen TVs.  People need cars.  People need iPods.
				<br /><br />
				I need money.
				<br /><br />
				Running a campaign is not cheap and in order to make change in Washington I need your change now – whatever you can scrounge up.  Go ahead, take a minute to check in the cushions in your sofa, I’ll wait.
				<br /><br />
				Find anything?  Good.  
				<br /><br />
				Men - check your wallet.  Remember that twenty you stashed in the hidden pocket to be used in an emergency?  Well what the heck can you buy with twenty bucks these days, so go ahead, send that on in as well.
				<br /><br />
				Women and cross-dressing men – check your purses.  I know some of you have really big purses and you’ve been wanting to clean them out and organize them for a while now, so why don’t you take a moment and do so.  Go ahead, I’ll wait again.  Find any change?  Good.  Send it on in.
				<br /><br />
				Now how about those bank accounts.  You know that extra money you’ve been setting aside for the vacation?  Well with all the deadlines at work and the kids in school you don’t have time to take that vacation, so go ahead and send me your vacation money.
				<br /><br />
				And don’t forget your 401(k)s your 403(b)s and your other retirement funds.  You are saving for your future – which is good – but exactly what kind of future are you saving for?  With the wrong person in office you won’t have any kind of a future at all.  In order to secure your future today send me your bucks for a better tomorrow.
				<br /><br />
				Change requires change and your change is better than my change so to see the change you want send me your change now.
				<br /><br />
				I am proud and honored to stand with you as we push forward to bring about the reforms that are so desperately needed for our nation's future. To help ensure I have the resources I need, make your contribution today.
				<br /><br />
				- Vote often, vote bakiwop!
