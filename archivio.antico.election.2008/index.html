				Thank goodness <em>that's</em> over! All the democrats could do was talk talk talk without resolving anything until they were forced to make a decision because they ran out of people to vote - which is, basically, their kind of politics.

				Dear Voter, I promise that when I raise funds for my election I will not only seek money from the rich - no!  Seeking money only from the rich is downright un-American!  I will seek money from every single American citizen regardless of financial status.

				Unlike these other candidates I do not have the prejudice and intolerance that they seem to embrace toward America's middle and lower socioeconomic classes.

				<br /><br />
				And it may be unconstitutional, not to mention fattening, too.
				<br /><br />
				I want you, dear Voter, to know that I will take money from both the rich fat cats in Washington and the drunken rummies on the street - you know, the ones with the 3 layers of grimy coats, the bottle of Thunderbird in a brown bag and the cardboard sign reading, "Wil werk 4 foode."

				<blockquote>
					I would like to give you money in the form of a payment for a campaign t shirt/bumper sticker. Especially your "walking for president" slogan.  Do you have any such thing set up?
					<br />
					- Jill D.
				</blockquote>
				Jill,
				<br /><br />
				I, unfortunately, have no such thing set up.  As you may have gathered from my "walking for president because running is too much damned work" campaign slogan I am a lazy sod and creating items in exchange for campaign contributions seems far too much like work.
				<br /><br />
				There is little concern over all this, however, as presidential campaign donations for items (such as t-shirts, bumper stickers, or plates at a campaign dinner) normally run in the tens of thousands of dollars.  Now, if you are from another country, say England, that would amount - after the exchange rate - to about 2.50 British Pounds Sterling.  However, I find most Americans unwilling to spend that much money on a bumper sticker or t-shirt.
				<br /><br />
				Even if I were to offer these items for campaign contributions I fear that, after I was elected, I would have to hunt down each and  every campaign contributor as they would possess nearly priceless campaign collectibles which could be used to fund terrorist activities.
				<br /><br />
				Unfortunately, after hunting you down and throwing you into a federal penitentiary you would probably not be able to vote for me again as many states have laws against felons voting in elections.  Throwing all my campaign contributors into jail would also have the effect of lessening my chances of raising money for my reelection campaign in 2012 and that is a risk I am simply not willing to take.
				<br /><br />
				I do appreciate your interest and hope you manage, somehow, to give me gobs of money at some point in the future.

				I promise that if you vote for me you will never have to stab a family member.  Ever.

				Unless, of course, you really want to.

				<blockquote>
					Mr. McCain’s likely nomination as the Republican candidate for president and the happenstance of his birth in the Panama Canal Zone in 1936 are reviving a musty debate that has surfaced periodically since the founders first set quill to parchment and declared that only a “natural-born citizen” can hold the nation’s highest office.
					<br /><br />
					To date, no American to take the presidential oath has had an official birthplace outside the 50 states.
					<br /><br />
					Mr. McCain was born on a military installation in the Canal Zone, where his mother and father, a Navy officer, were stationed. 
				</blockquote>
				Do you really want a foreigner running our great country?  Nothing against foreigners - some foreigners are great people - but allowing one to run our country?  No way.
				<br /><br />
				John McCain - you are no natural-born citizen!  America - You deserve better! You deserve a U.S. born-and-bred citizen running this country and I am that man.

				<blockquote>
					Ralph Nader is launching a third-party campaign for president.
					<br /><br />
					The consumer advocate made the announcement Sunday on NBC's "Meet the Press." He says most Americans are disenchanted with the Democratic and Republican parties, and that none of the presidential contenders are addressing ways to stem corporate crime and Pentagon waste and promote labor rights.

				Thank goodness! Someone officially in the race that will get fewer votes than me.

				If you all work very hard and give me lots of money, together we can make me the President of the United States while you have to keep your lousy, non-president job.
