<p>Happy New Year!</p>
<p>It's a strange one this year. For me, anything after 2010 or so started feeling sci-fi future-y. That time where 1) I frankly never thought about living that long, and 2) it was legitimately the time frame where we should have had the full Jetson's experience - <a href="https://www.bing.com/images/search?q=George+Jetson+Flying+Car&form=RESTAB&first=1">flying cars</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_The_Jetsons_characters#Rosie">robot majordomos</a>, <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90879096/jetsons-future-of-work">two hour work weeks</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-scarcity">a post-scarcity society</a>. Now? 2026? It doesn't feel like that kind of future anymore. It feels like a post-future future. A <a href="https://www.theterminatorfans.com/scanline-vfx-breakdown-of-terminator-dark-fates-future-war-dam-scenes/">dystopian Terminatoresque kinda future</a>. Think <cite><a href="https://search.worldcat.org/search?q=ti%3A1984+AND+au%3Ageorge+orwell&itemSubType=book-printbook&itemSubTypeModified=book-printbook">1984</a></cite> with time traveling killer robots, only the robots don't have to time travel to kill anybody because we're destroying ourselves quite nicely without their help, thank you very much.</p>
<p>I picture Skynet watching our past, evaluating, deliberating, then deciding, "Shit, there's nothing I can do to them that would be worse than what they're doing to themselves." Skynet would probably deem it too cruel to send Terminators back into our world.</p>
<p>Cruel to the Terminators.</p>
<p>And yes, I know, New Year's is supposed to be about positive change and the promise of a better tomorrow.</p>
<p>On an individual level? For a distinct and privileged minority of individuals? I think that <em>can</em> be true. For us fortunate few we can try to live deliberately, to find ways to allow for love, patience, honesty and accountability for ourselves and others. Choose a better life.</p>
<p>And for that kind of thing? You have to put in the work.</p>
<p>When my <a href="dramatis.personae.html#father">father</a> died a year and a half or so ago, my <a href="dramatis.personae.html#wife">wife</a> and I drove 2000 miles (and change) in about a day and a half. There were no shortcuts. There was no way to fast forward through it. There was no cut and paste of miles. We couldn't bullshit our way into a shorter drive. It had to happen and there was no way to get around, under, or over it. We just had to plow through. Our mantra became: you have to put in the miles. The thing about putting in the miles, though, is that it can be a beautiful thing.</p>

</p>
<p>The video above was taken on that drive. Yes, we may have to put in the miles, without shortcuts, to live a better life for ourselves and those around us, but if we remember to pay attention, even during a day-and-a-half cross country slog, even during the thousandth commute to the same job in the same building in the same city, there are moments of beauty, and it's not just the moments that can be beautiful, the entire endeavor can be beautiful. The amount of effort and time spent doing a horrible and difficult thing can be beautiful.</p>
<p>But on a societal level? I used to have hope that we were stumbling our way to a better society, a more inclusive and accepting society, but, for the most part, the people we choose to lead us, the prejudices we allow to flourish, and the money and power we allow people to accumulate, well, I hope that this is the last hurrah for those kind of things, the last hurrah before a glorious new tomorrow, but I fear it is just the beginning of an accelerating downward spiral of ick.</p>
<p>But. But! While I may have no power over society's giant flush to the septic tank of doom, that doesn't mean <em>I</em> can't live more deliberately, and allow for as much love, patience, honesty, and accountability as I can muster for myself and those around me.</p>
<p>And? Let's face it. If society is gonna collapse into some late stage capitalist boondoggle? One where we have to swear fealty to billionaires? One where we have to put in 80 hour work weeks and sleep in the company dorm and eat company slurry in the company cafeteria? We might as well have as good a time as we can doing it.</p>

<p>My <a href="dramatis.personae.html#wife">wife</a> and I went exploring yesterday.</p>
<p>Our property backs up to a forest. A small forest, true, it's about 700 feet wide and about 4500 feet long, but a forest nonetheless.</p>
<p>The cool thing about the forest, or, I guess I should say <em>one</em> of the cool things about the forest, for there are many cool things about the forest, is that running down the middle of it is a creek that winds it's way around the forest floor and discharges into the Pacific Ocean. Another cool thing? That creek is at sea level. That means from the rear edge of our house to the creek is about 300 feet horizontally and about 125 feet vertically.</p>
<p>It's a steep forest.</p>
<p>Walking in the forest isn't so easy. There are a bunch of deer paths, which is nice, but the ground can be very soft in places, spongy, and the moss that covers darn near everything can be slippery, especially in the rain. It's the Oregon Coast, it rains a lot, but it's not like you can wait for a not rainy day to do stuff, you know, because of all the rain.</p>
<p>We didn't make any giant discoveries - no lost temples, ancient civilizations, or obscene riches were discovered - but it was a nifty walk in a nifty place with nifty company.</p>
<p>Good way to start the new year.</p> 
<p>P.S. - From our front yard it's about 130 feet to the bluff overlooking the Pacific Ocean where it's a 125 foot drop (over a horizontal distance of 150 feet) to the beach. All the shifting sands and poorly rooted plants would make the bluff a much more dangerous "walk" but we've never had the opportunity to try as between us and the edge of the bluff lay some very expensive housing. The beaches may be public, but the adjacent land isn't always.</p>
<p>P.P.S. - Ooo! I almost forgot! There's a mystery swing set! It's the weirdest thing! Once every year or so I hear kids playing on a swing set. You can't really see the swing set from our property (even though it's only two properties away from ours)...well...you can kind of see it? Sort of? Like, just the top corner of it? And that's mostly in the winter when there's slightly less greenery in the way (again, it's the Oregon Coast, there's <em>always</em> greenery in the way). So i tried making my way through the forest toward it and got this picture.</p>

<p>I woke up New Year's morning with the lyrics, "gotta gotta get up to get down" playing over and over in my head. Good way to start the year, for you do, indeed, have to get up to get down. I couldn't remember much else from the song, or who the artist was, and when I looked up the lyrics it turns out it was from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coolio">Coolio's</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2KRH27aWcU"><cite>1,2,3,4 (Sumpin' New)</cite></a>. Listening to the rest of the lyrics was...less inspiring...but 'gotta gotta get up to get down' is a good reminder to hustle a bit in the New Year.</p>
<p>The last movie we watched before the New Year was <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2194499"><cite>About Time</cite></a>. We were looking for one of those British feel good romance type deals. Found it. Didn't totally dig it. Kinda nice. Kinda sappy. Kinda...what...hmmm...I guess my problem is this: You have the chance to...not be rich...but to be comfortable? Money-wise? And you don't take it?</p>
<p>I know. I know. Bill Nighy's character warns his son that money is bad, but, really? I'm not talking winning billions of dollars in the lottery, just a couple mil, you know? So you wouldn't have to worry about rent and groceries and health care? Think of all the time Domhnall Gleeson and Rachel McAdams could have spent together, and with their families, and with their children! It must just be me because I think <a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt2194499/">the movie was successful</a>, but, still...just...really?</p>
<p>I think the movie makers tried to couch it by giving the leads "professional" careers - lawyer (ewww!) and publisher reader. And again, I get it, it's nice to have a career that you actually want and can feel proud of (lawyer, though? really?!) but, it's like this: I have a career I am proud of - every day I get to help people and not charge them so much as a single dime. And I make a pretty decent wage. It's a good gig, but I tell ya, I would give it up in a heartbeat to spend more time with loved ones, to spend more time exploring and learning and just plain old not worrying about money.</p>
<p>Eh. It's probably just me.</p>
<p>As a palate cleanser, <a href="dramatis.personae.html#wife">wife</a> put on <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1684562/"><cite>Fall Guy</cite></a>. Yeah. Just the right amount of story, cheese, and action for the New Year.</p>
