<p>Happy New Year!</p>
<p>It's a strange one this year. For me, anything after 2010 or so started feeling sci-fi future-y. That time where 1) I frankly never thought about living that long, and 2) it was legitimately the time frame where we should have had the full Jetson's experience - <a href="https://www.bing.com/images/search?q=George+Jetson+Flying+Car&form=RESTAB&first=1">flying cars</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_The_Jetsons_characters#Rosie">robot majordomos</a>, <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90879096/jetsons-future-of-work">two hour work weeks</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-scarcity">a post-scarcity society</a>. Now? 2026? It doesn't feel like that kind of future anymore. It feels like a post-future future. A <a href="https://www.theterminatorfans.com/scanline-vfx-breakdown-of-terminator-dark-fates-future-war-dam-scenes/">dystopian Terminatoresque kinda future</a>. Think <cite><a href="https://search.worldcat.org/search?q=ti%3A1984+AND+au%3Ageorge+orwell&itemSubType=book-printbook&itemSubTypeModified=book-printbook">1984</a></cite> with time traveling killer robots, only the robots don't have to time travel to kill anybody because we're destroying ourselves quite nicely without their help, thank you very much.</p>
<p>I picture Skynet watching our past, evaluating, deliberating, then deciding, "Shit, there's nothing I can do to them that would be worse than what they're doing to themselves." Skynet would probably deem it too cruel to send Terminators back into our world.</p>
<p>Cruel to the Terminators.</p>
<p>And yes, I know, New Year's is supposed to be about positive change and the promise of a better tomorrow.</p>
<p>On an individual level? For a distinct and privileged minority of individuals? I think that <em>can</em> be true. For us fortunate few we can try to live deliberately, to find ways to allow for love, patience, honesty and accountability for ourselves and others. Choose a better life.</p>
<p>And for that kind of thing? You have to put in the work.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240509171720/https://www.gmtoday.com/daily_news/obituaries/francis-f-baiocchi/article_f0c855be-f86c-11ee-a7c9-afed44858a20.html">When my dad died a year and a half or so ago</a>, my wife and I drove 2000 miles (and change) in about a day and a half. There were no shortcuts. There was no way to fast forward through it. There was no cut and paste of miles. We couldn't bullshit our way into a shorter drive. It had to happen and there was no way to get around, under, or over it. We just had to plow through. Our mantra became: you have to put in the miles. The thing about putting in the miles, though, is that it can be a beautiful thing.</p>

</p>
<p>The video above was taken on that drive. Yes, we may have to put in the miles, without shortcuts, to live a better life for ourselves and those around us, but if we remember to pay attention, even during a day-and-a-half cross country slog, even during the thousandth commute to the same job in the same building in the same city, there are moments of beauty, and it's not just the moments that can be beautiful, the entire endeavor can be beautiful. The amount of effort and time spent doing a horrible and difficult thing can be beautiful.</p>
<p>But on a societal level? I used to have hope that we were stumbling our way to a better society, a more inclusive and accepting society, but, for the most part, the people we choose to lead us, the prejudices we allow to flourish, and the money and power we allow people to accumulate, well, I hope that this is the last hurrah for those kind of things, the last hurrah before a glorious new tomorrow, but I fear it is just the beginning of an accelerating downward spiral of ick.</p>
<p>But. But! While I may have no power over society's giant flush to the septic tank of doom, that doesn't mean <em>I</em> can't live more deliberately, and allow for as much love, patience, honesty, and accountability as I can muster for myself and those around me.</p>
<p>And? Let's face it. If society is gonna collapse into some late stage capitalist boondoggle? One where we have to swear fealty to billionaires? One where we have to put in 80 hour work weeks and sleep in the company dorm and eat company slurry in the company cafeteria? We might as well have as good a time as we can doing it.</p>
