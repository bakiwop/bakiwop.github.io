			<p><span class="title">Dwarf Fights For Right To Get Tossed</span><br />David Flood, a 37-year-old Florida man wants his "inalienable human right" to get tossed in bars protected. "As soon as you have a physical handicap ... all of the sudden they treat you like you don't have a mind of your own,'' Flood said. "Just because I'm 3-foot-2 doesn't mean I can't make decisions.'' Flood is referring to a 1989 Florida law stating that dwarf-tossing is illegal and punishable by fines or loss of the establishment's alcohol license.<br /><br /> David Flood recently went on the radio, asking for a lawyer to help him with his case. Michael Steinberg answered Flood's call. "This law singles out people with dwarfism,'' said Steinberg. "He doesn't feel that he's disabled, he just feels shorter than other people.'' Steinberg also said that he would take the case for free.<br /><br />When asked if he could trust a lawyer that he had hired over the radio and that was working for free, Flood said, "I trust him as far as he can throw me."</p>
			<p><span class="title">Actually...</span><br />A new Harvard study has found that rich people actually are happier than poor people. "Oh yeah," said Ollie Clifton, a man who was once unemployed but then won a $20 million lottery jackpot, "being rich is way better than being poor. I'm much happier." The Harvard study compared people who "did what they loved and let the money follow" as many high school and college career counselors tell students and people who were "filthy rich". People who were filthy rich were, on average, 5000 times happier than those who took their career counselor's advice.</p>
