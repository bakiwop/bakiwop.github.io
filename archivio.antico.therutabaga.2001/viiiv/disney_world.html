					<p>Colleen Champ, spokesperson for Disney said, "The planet earth will be renamed Disney World. Prepare to be assimilated."</p>
					<p>That's right, Disney now owns everything.  Absolutely everything.</p>
					<p>"We were wondering where to take the company next," said Michael Eisner, CEO of Disney. "We were all just sitting around one day wondering what Disney's next big thing would be and then someone said something about Disney World."</p>
					<p>Eisner said that he couldn't remember which state Disney World was in, "I always get Disney World and Disney Land mixed up.  I know one is in Florida and the other is in California, but I can never keep them straight." But his confusion soon turned to joy as the idea dawned on him, the idea of an actual Disney World.</p>
					<p>Before he could start the planning for a Disney World, he had to crunch some numbers. "I had some of our financial people look into how much money we actually had in the bank. I mean, the world is a pretty big place, so I wasn't quite sure if we had all the money we would need to finance an endeavor like this. They came back with a number. I gave that number to some of our accountants and they said it was possible - they said that we could buy the world.  I was so happy."</p>
					<p>"I know some people might be a little worried about this," Eisner continued, "but don't be. Disney World may own you and all of your loved ones, but that doesn't mean that we'll actually <em>own you</em>.  Ha ha!  Well, actually, it does mean just exactly that. But don't worry - because I say not to. Disney will continue to respect the rights of people and cultures just as it always has in the past. Don't worry about that whole "assimilation thing" that Colleen was talking about earlier - it won't hurt a bit."</p>
