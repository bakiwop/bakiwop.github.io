				<p><span class="title">Interview: Psam the Psychotic Psychic</span></p>
					<p>Psam the Psychotic Psychic has been a psychic for over 500 years, spanning 15 different lives.  In his different lives he has been a male human, a female human, a female chimpanzee, and a male gerbil; he has led very diverse lives including a gig as the Bishop of Canterbury and that of a garbage man in Queens - he claims that there was little difference between the two jobs.  Psam took a few moments to answer some of our questions.</p>
					<p>Rutabaga: So Psam, thanks for being here.  How are you doing today?</p>
					<p>Psam the Psychotic Psychic: I knew you were going to say that. Ha ha! Just a little joke of mine. But I did know you were going to say that.</p>
					<p>R: What's the strangest life you've ever lived?</p>
					<p>PPP: Well, once, around the 1750s or so, I lived on this mysterious, forbidden island that had many trapped spirits on it.</p>
					<p>R: What was it called?</p>
					<p>PPP: The Mysterious Forbidden Island of Many Trapped Spirits - we didn't have much imagination back then.</p>
					<p>R: We?</p>
					<p>PPP: Yes. I didn't live there alone, I had an imaginary friend back then - his name was Herbert. Mind you, I was only on my seventh or eighth life back then.  Imaginary friends are commonplace for those who are only on their seventh or eighth life.</p>
					<p>R: I'd like to test out your psychic abilities if you don't mind?  Good.  I have here a comb, what can you tell me about it?</p>
					<p>PPP: Ahhh. Very interesting.  This is a used comb, and used fairly recently - say in the last year or so.  I believe it was used to comb someone's hair.</p>
					<p>R: "Very recently" includes going back an entire year?</p>
					<p>PPP: Well...yes. You see, for someone who has lived 15 lives, a year is a fairly short period of time.</p>
					<p>R: I understand that you have started a psychic phone service and are in talks with CBS to star in your own 1 hour reality television series called "Psam the Psychotic Psychic's Psychology Hour".  Tell us more about that.</p>
					<p>PPP: Well, the phone service started when I saw other psychics advertising for their services on television. I have had this psychic ability for the past 15 lives, but I never knew how to turn a profit from it.  I mean, I was just a psychic, what were my actual employable skills?  I couldn't type, I don't know how to use a computer, and I don't know how to read or write - so I just stuck with very simple jobs like those of bishop or garbage man. But when I saw a commercial for a psychic hotline I thought to myself, 'hey, I can do that!', so I called up Miss Cleo and asked if I could be one of her phone psychics.  I did that for a while, learned the ins and outs of the business, and then left to start my own psychic hotline, which can be reached at 1-700-PSYCHIC.  It's $5 for the first minute and $10 each additional minute - you will be charged for the time you are on hold.</p>
					<p>R: And your television show?</p>
					<p>PPP: Oh yes.  CBS.  Well, "Psam the Psychotic Psychic's Psychology Hour" is just a working title right now.  CBS wanted to throw the word "psychology" in the title to make it seem more legit, but, I mean, seriously, who believes in all that psychology stuff anyway?  I am trying to convince them to go with the title, "Psam the Psychotic Psychic's Pspiritual Hour" or "P4" for short - kind of catchy, don't ya think?  What will happen on the show is I will pick members of the audience at random, ask them to give me something personal of theirs, like a wallet or a purse, and then I will remove all their money and make something "psychic" up to appease them. With any luck, they will be so emotionally distraught over the lies I tell them about dead family members that they will not realize that I have taken their money until it is too late.</p>
