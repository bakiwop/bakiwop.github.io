					<p>The United States FBI had recently offered a $25 million reward for Osama bin Laden; there were no takers. Many critics of the reward said that it was not enough money, suggesting that bin Laden could easily match the monetary award and that something else would have to be offered instead. Others thought that the reward had no meaning for the hundreds of people that have access to Osama bin Laden on a daily basis, stating that the desert people valued food and water more than they valued money.</p>
					<p>Two days ago, the FBI changed their reward of information leading to the capture of Osama bin Laden from $25 million to 25 camels. Yesterday, over 30 former Taliban supporters dragged Osama bin Laden into the city of Tora Bora demanding their reward.</p>
					<p>"We are so happy to be receiving all these camels," said Mahtomedhei Musamaristafa, a former Taliban supporter and now-owner of camels, "these camels will help support my family for generations!"</p>
					<p>When asked why he wanted the 25 camels over the $25 million Mahtomedhei replied, "Why would I want 25 million pieces of paper?  Sure, it might keep me and my family warm for a while in the cool desert nights, but camels, whoo!  Camels are just wonderful!"</p>
					<p>Pete Firepod, Special Agent in Charge of the Osama bin Laden case, was the person responsible for the change in the reward.</p>
					<p>"We weren't getting any good information about Osama with the monetary reward," said Special Agent Pete, "and Washington was starting to get a bit nervous about catching Osama, so we had to come up with a plan fast.  After talking with some of the Taliban members that were captured, we came to realize that money means very little to them, when asked what a good reward would be, one of them said 'forty doe-eyed virgins', but most of them said 'camels...many camels'. So we changed the reward and a day later, these thirty men dragged Osama into camp asking where their camels were.  It was wonderful."</p>
					<p>After the camel tax that the U.S. is imposing on the reward, the actual number of camels that each of the thirty informants will receive is about 15 1/2, but as Mahtomedhei put it, "That's okay. 15 1/2 camels is still a wonderful gift to receive for turning in the man we worshipped as a god."</p>
