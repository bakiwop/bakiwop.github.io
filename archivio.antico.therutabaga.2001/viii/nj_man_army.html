<p>With the recent attacks on the United States, men and women from all over the country have been signing up with the armed forces.</p>
<p>"There is a renewed sense of patriotism in today's young people," said David Sturham, Army recruiter in New Jersey. "It's just wonderful to see all these kids signing up for the military to show their love and support for our great country."</p>
<p>"Yeah! I signed up for the Army. I'm entering in a week and they said with all my experience that I would be a colonel right away!" said Eric Crosby, a new recruit from New Jersey.</p>
<p>When this reporter pointed out that it didn't sound possible, Eric replied, "What! What are you talking about? I walked right into the special operations recruitment group of the military and they said they would be thrilled to have me!"</p>
<p>When asked what the name of the "special operations" group was, Eric said, "The Salvation Army. I'm going to be a colonel in the Salvation Army!"</p>
<p>When told what the Salvation Army actually was, Eric replied, "What the hell?"</p>
<p>"I thought that it was called the Salvation Army because this special unit of the army would be the salvation of all Americans against the Taliban. You mean I'm just going to be helping a bunch of lazy, homeless people? Shit." </p>
