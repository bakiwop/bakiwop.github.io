				<p><span class="title">Stoners To Harry Potter: Duuuuuude, Great Movie!</span></p>
				<p>Harry Potter has been playing in theaters at all times of the day and night to meet demand from movie-goers. This has brought a perhaps unintended, but nevertheless welcome, addition to the Harry Potter fan club.</p>
				<p>The stoners.</p>
				<p>That's right ... potheads.</p>
				<p>Because of demand, theaters have been offering midnight showings of the wildly popular Harry Potter movie - but because of the time, it isn't the little kids to go to see Harry, it's the stoners - and it is proving to be a very popular movie with these dopers.</p>
				<p>"Duuuuuude, Harry Potter rocks!" said one stoner who said he would like to remain anonymous. "My name is Tim Thomlinson. My friends and I have this game that we play during the movie. You see, every time Harry's name is said, we all take a toke. Every time that big, hairy dude - whats-his-name, you know, Hagrat or Haggard or Tagrat or whatever - says 'I shouldn't have told you that' we take two tokes, and whenever they mentioned 'he who should not be named' we take three. It's a great game. Paaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrrrrtttttttttttttyyyyyyy! Woohoo! Led Zeppelin rocks!"</p>
				<p>It isn't just these late night movie-goers who are enjoying the visit though, theater owners are very happy to be getting the business.</p>
				<p>"The stoners weren't exactly the target demographic of the movie, but they've turned out to be some of the best customers," said Melissa Everling, manager at the Mall Of America's General Cinema movie theater in Minneapolis, MN. "These stoners show up, pay to get into the movie, and start smoking.  We all know what happens when people get stoned - they get the munchies. In one midnight showing, these stoners buy more candy and popcorn than all of my day shows combined. As you can well imagine, it's a pretty big profit for us! Another plus is that after a day or two, they forget they have seen the movie and they come back again - it's just wonderful."</p>
				<p>One stoner had this to say, "Duuuuude, we just figure we're being patriotic! The president's asked all Americans to go out and spend money, so we are - we rock! Kick Osama's ass!"</p>
