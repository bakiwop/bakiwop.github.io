					<p>While scientists have recently been making highly publicized breakthroughs in the science of cold fusion - long thought to be the most environmentally clean (necessitating only lithium and sea water) and economical bang for a person's buck - there has been some new research done on a power source that would make using nuclear fusion look like the burning of fossil fuels.</p>
					<p>Cheese.</p>
					<p>Professor Johann Glick, Director of Cheese Science at the Stockholm Institute of Technology, believes cheese may be the future of extremely cheap, non-polluting power for all mankind. "Cheese may be the future of extremely cheap, non-polluting power for all mankind," Professor Glick said in an interview earlier today.</p>
					<p>The name of this new science dedicated to cheese as a power source? Cheese fusion.</p>
					<p>It works like this. You take some cheese, cheddar or monterey jack will do, although gouda is the cheese of choice for industrial power needs, and you run a small electrical current through it. That's it. That's all there is to it. Some cheese and a small electrical current. It is estimated that one small piece of gouda can produce enough electricity for a town the size of New York city for over 50 years, and that includes all sources of power - commercial, residential, and municipal - without any kind of byproduct.</p>
					<p>"Fossil fuels' byproducts are very environmentally unsafe, everyone knows that, and cold fusion's byproduct is helium - which in and of itself can be dangerous. I mean, imagine, after years of using cold fusion, metric ton upon metric ton of helium being released into our atmosphere. Sure, it might be fun to fill up a few balloons at first, but pretty soon, with all that helium floating around, everyone is going to have a squeaky voice. That could lead to mass chaos! Just imagine 1-900 phone sex operators answering the phone and sounding like Mickey Mouse, we're talking about the potential collapse of entire industries here! You won't get that with cheese fusion."</p>
					<p>When asked how he came up with the idea of cheese fusion, Professor Glick said, "Well, to be quite honest, me and some of my colleagues were drunk. We had been watching television and saw one of those 'The Power of Cheese' commercials and the idea just kind of grew from there."</p>
					<p>Recent developments in cheese fusion have proved very interesting. "The moon has long been known as a vast, unexploited source of cheese. We have tested some samples of cheese from the moon, lunar cheese if you will, and have discovered that lunar cheese provides just over three times the power of terrestrial cheese. If we could develop the technology to mine lunar cheese, or better yet, synthesize the lunar cheese from our terrestrial cheeses - well, it would just be really neat-o." </p>
