				<p><span class="title"><em>Copa Cabana</em> Coma</span></p>
					<p>Jeff Winters was working last Monday morning and feeling pretty glum about it.</p>
					<p>"He just didn't seem to want to be at work," said coworker Sandy Morgan. "Who can blame him? It was Monday. It was early. It's always hard to get going on a Monday morning."</p>
					<p>Then he heard a song on the radio, <em>Copa Cabana</em>, by Barry Manilow, and he started cheering up.</p>
					<p>"It was amazing!" Ms. Morgan said. "He must have heard the song around 11 or so, because at our 11:30 meeting he was so happy.  He had to give a presentation on the past fiscal quarter and he did a fabulous job.  He would show us a pie chart or two and then do a little latin dance while humming that Barry Manilow song. It was quite the presentation! For the rest of the day, whenever I saw him, he would be humming along to that song and smiling a little bit.  He seemed so happy."</p>
					<p>When Mr. Winters came in on Tuesday morning, he seemed a bit tired.</p>
					<p>"We had another 11:30 meeting.  He wasn't presenting anything this time, he just showed up to listen. Every time there was a break in the presentation you could hear him humming, 'Her name was Lola. She was a showgirl.' under his breath.  He looked a little tired, but otherwise he seemed to be doing all right. Jeff was a party-guy, so we had all just assumed that he had been out late last night - I remember Rob, a guy from accounting, giving him a hard time over how much fun he must have had to be looking so tired. Jeff just smiled at him and kept humming."</p>
					<p>On Wednesday, Mr. Winters looked like a complete wreck. There were dark circles under his eyes and he couldn't stand up straight, he kept weaving from side to side.  Coworkers said he kept humming <em>Copa Cbana</em> under his breath.</p>
					<p>Then, around 10:00, he passed out.</p>
					<p>"Jeff and I were going over some SR-10 reports and he was having a lot of trouble concentrating.  His eyes kept closing - he looked like he was going to pass out. I asked him if he was feeling okay and he just said, 'I can't get this damn song out of my head.'  Then he did it. He passed out."</p>
					<p>Mr. Winters was admitted to Saint Luke's hospital, and, for the last three days, has been lying in a coma.  Doctors have not been able to find any physical reason for the coma, so they are currently working under the assumption that it was the song that did it to him.</p>
					<p>"This seems to be a rather extreme case of a person getting a song stuck in their head. We haven't had any luck with the normal medical treatments, so we have been trying some rather unorthodox therapy to try and bring Mr. Winters around," said Dr. Humani, Chief of Internal Medicine at St. Luke's. "We've been playing Tom Jones' <em>It's Not Unusual</em> and Wayne Newton's <em>Danke Schoen</em> 24 hours a day - but so far he hasn't been responsive to either of these new songs. If you listen closely, you can still hear Mr. Winters humming <em>Copa Cabana</em> under his breath"</p>
					<p>When Barry Manilow learned that listening to his music had caused someone to go into a coma - a first as far as doctors have been able to tell - he released this statement, "<em>Copa Cabana</em> has always been one of my favorite songs. It's such a catchy tune! It does not surprise me in the least that someone would hum it over and over until their body just gave up - it is just that good of a song. By the way, did you know that <em>Copa Cabana</em> was based upon real events that happened to me while I was at a bar? Yes. Although I am not sure if the showgirl's name was actually Lola - I never could remember her name, but she did have yellow feathers in her hair. Oh yes, don't forget to buy my newest album coming out in stores December 13."</p>
