					<p>The National Retail Federation says that the three-day weekend after Thanksgiving is the busiest shopping weekend of the year, and that the sales during the weekend reflect how well or poorly sales for the rest of the holiday season will fare.</p>
					<p>Mary O'Donnell, spokesperson for the Federation said, "We have seen an increase in sales of 2 to 3% over the previous year.  This does not bode well for retailers."</p>
					<p>According to Ms. O'Donnell, retailers need at least a 5% increase over the previous year in order to keep up with inflation.</p>
					<p>"Just having an increase over the previous year is never good enough. There is an increased cost in goods and services  - basically just inflation - and the 2 to 3% increase in sales is not enough to keep up with that inflation."</p>
					<p>"Let me give you an example," she said. "You know that lousy 2 to 3% raise you get every year from your boss? If your lucky? Well, that never covers the increase in living expenses that you see from year to year, right? Well, it's the same for retailers. Just getting a 2 to 3% increase isn't enough.  It doesn't cover the bills for the new year."</p>
					<p>Ms. O'Donnell went on to say that CEOs, CIOs, CFOs and VPs will be feeling the crunch this holiday season. "Their annual salary increases average about 20 to 30% a year.  If people don't start buying more, then they might have to settle for salary increases of only 15% - this is totally unacceptable."</p>
					<p>"I'd like to take this opportunity, as the spokesperson for the National Retail Federation, to tell everybody to spend more money.  Please.  If you don't, we'll just lay more of you off.  Thank you."</p>
