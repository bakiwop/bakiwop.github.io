				<p><span class="title">President Bush: "Mother Nature Is America's New Evil Enemy"</span></p>
					<p>President Bush released an emergency statement in the White House press room earlier today regarding what he is calling "America's new evil enemy" - mother nature.</p>
					<p>"We must all strive together to fight this new evil that threatens the lives of all Americans," he said. "Mother nature has had her way long enough! No longer shall Americans sit idly by while mother nature has her way with us. We are calling this new fight against mother nature 'Operation Double-Super-Infinite Destroy The Planet'."</p>
					<p>[ pause for applause ]</p>
					<p>"As many of you may know, over the past weekend, America has experienced all kinds of incl ...inahcl ... incuh ... how do you pronounce this word?"</p>
					<p>"Can you spell it, Mr. President?"</p>
					<p>"I N C L E M E N T"</p>
					<p>"That would be 'inclement', Mr. President."</p>
					<p>"And what does 'inclement' mean?"</p>
					<p>"'Bad', Mr. President."</p>
					<p>"Really?"</p>
					<p>"Yes, Mr. President."</p>
					<p>"Interesting."</p>
					<p>"As many of you may know, over the past weekend, America has experienced all kinds of inclement weather - tornados, flooding, and snow storms. This weather is expected to continue into the early parts of this week. This is unacceptable."</p>
					<p>[ pause for applause ]</p>
					<p>"When I asked who was responsible for this bad weather, my aides told me that it was 'just mother nature'. I have vowed that all resources at my disposal, all of the resources of the United States of America, shall be thrown into this new fight against this mother nature person!"</p>
					<p>[ pause for applause ]</p>
					<p>"We shall destroy mother nature completely!"</p>
					<p>[ pause for applause ]</p>
					<p>"I am asking for the help of all citizens in this matter.  What I need for you to do is this: go out and spend as much money as you possibly can!"</p>
					<p>[ pause for applause ]</p>
					<p>"That's right!  The more money you spend, the richer I and my colleagues get...I mean, the more money you spend the more waste you produce, the more waste you produce, the more you hurt mother nature!"</p>
					<p>[ pause for applause ]</p>
					<p>"But spending beyond your means may not be enough, my fellow Americans. What I need for you to do is drive more so you use up more gas and get more oil changes.  Don't get an oil change every 5000 miles like the manual says, or every 3000 miles like the oil change places say, but rather every 500 miles! Yes!  Change your oil every 500 miles! Show that bitch mother nature who's boss!"</p>
					<p>[ pause for applause ]</p>
					<p>"Did I get that part right, Dick?"</p>
					<p>"Yes, Mr. President."</p>
					<p>"Excellent."</p>
					<p>"My fellow Americans.  If we come together as a nation and spend as much money as we can to fight this evil, horrible, really bad menace known as mother nature - we will have made America great again! When we finally destroy the planet's natural resources and kill this mother nature person, America will be FREE!"</p>
					<p>[ pause for applause ]</p>
					<p>"America is great!"</p>
					<p>[ pause for applause ]</p>
					<p>"America is beautiful!"</p>
					<p>[ pause for applause ]</p>
					<p>"Yay America!"</p>
					<p>[ pause for applause ]</p>
					<p>"America!"</p>
					<p>[ long pause for applause ]</p>
					<p>"God bless America."</p>
