<h1 class="enorme">Fake Holy Water Purveyor</h1>

<p>he sold vials of fake holy water to vampire hunters for $57/bottle...</p>
<p>...figuring those who spent $57 on a twee vial of water could afford to be taken advantage of...</p>
<p>...also figuring that those who used it and lived didn't really need it and those who used it and died couldn't sue him...</p>
<p>because, you know, he was selling the "holy water" to vampire hunters...</p>
<p>...and if the vampire hunter used the fake holy water against a vampire she was chasing and lived then it wasn't a real vampire she was chasing...</p>
<p>...and if the vampire hunter used the fake holy water against a real vampire then she would most assuredly die and not be able to sue him ...</p>
<p>...although the now deceased vampire hunter could, potentially, come back as an undead ex-vampire hunter and kill him for selling the fake holy water...</p>
<p>...and then, since he sold fake holy water, he wouldn't be able to protect himself against the undead ex- vampire hunter/customer...</p>
<p>...which would, you know, suck (both literally and figuratively) for him....</p>
<p>...so why, might you ask, didn't he just go legit in the vampire hunter holy water world and sell real holy water to vampire hunters in the 1st place...</p>
<p>...to which he would respond, "yo!" (because that's how he spoke) "have you seen the mad prices dem priests are charging t' bless da h<sub>2</sub>o"...</p>
<p>...and then perhaps, after hearing his silly way of speaking, you wouldn't feel so bad about him being killed by an undead ex-vampire hunter/customer...</p>
<p>...while at the same time hoping that the ex- vampire hunter/customer would finish him off and not, instead, make him a vampire as well...</p>
<p>...because really, who wants to hear a vampire saying things like, "i gots da mad undead skillz, yo!" while being being drained of blood ...</p>
<p>...honestly, just kill me please, ex-purveyor-of-fake-holy-water, and save me the bad gangster wannabe lingo...</p>
<p>...to which the undead ex-purveyor-of-fake-holy-water vampire would respond, "what da hell is 'ingo yo? is dat da thing dat ate dat baby?"...</p>
<p>...and then you'd be stuck explaining what 'lingo' meant to a vampire with the IQ of a jellyfish...</p>
<p>...and by the time you were done explaining it to him you'd really want the eternal embrace of death because he was that annoying...</p>
<p>...but then he wouldn't kill you, but rather make you into one of his vampire bros...</p>
<p>...and you'd be stuck with him for all eternity, hearing him say things like, "dag yo! playa had some mad blood up in dem veins!"...</p>
<p>...and, "this blood is all dat ana bag a chips!"...</p>
<p>...until one annoying day, annoyingly far in the annoying future, you'd realize that you simply couldn't deal with him anymore and would contemplate suicide...</p>
<p>...but would initially despair because you were already dead - well, undead - and darned near immortal and thus pretty hard to kill, yo...</p>
<p>...and when you thought the word 'yo' you would redouble your efforts toward ending it all because you'd realize you were starting to speak like him...</p>
<p>...just as you were starting to drive the stake through your heart you'd be so perturbed that he'd live while you died...</p>
<p>...and then it hit you...</p>
<p>...you could end it all for yourself by killing him because he was your maker - every vampire he made would die if you killed him...</p>
<p>...you'd met many of the other vampires he'd made, they were just like him, saying "yo!" and "tru dat"...</p>
<p>...you'd be doing the world a favor...</p>
<p>...so that very night, with much glee and a light, non-beating heart, you'd stake the annoying undead ex-purveyor-of-fake-holy-water vampire...</p>
<p>...as he turned to dust in front of you he'd blink back a single blood tear and whisper, "bitchez!" with his last breath...</p>
<p>...which would make you feel bad for a moment until, from all around the world, your undead super hearing heard thousands of undead whisper, "bitchez!" before dying...</p>
<p>...then you'd wonder why you hadn't turned to dust with your maker and why you no longer craved blood or could turn into a vampire bat...</p>
<p>...you'd wander around for a while and then watch your 1st sunrise in over 100 years. you'd realize that god was pleased with your work...</p>
<p>...after the beautiful sunrise you'd slowly rise toward heaven and god would say to you, "mad propz on killing dat annoying vampire, yo!"</p>
