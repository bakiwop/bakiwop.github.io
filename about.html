<h1 class="enorme">About</h1>

<p>These two quotes from <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093779/"><em>The Princess Bride</em></a> describe me fairly well: No one of consequence. Get used to disappointment.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=tobago+%22relaxed%252C+slow-paced+and+largely+undeveloped">This description of Tobago</a> also applies: relaxed, slow-paced and largely undeveloped.</p>

<p>I had a very short story of mine, <a href="piggly.wiggly.html"><em>Piggly Wiggly</em></a>, <a href="https://nuzzle-house.pinecast.co/episode/49e65cd0/piggly-wiggly-by-anonymous">read by Nuzzle House</a> in <a href="https://linktr.ee/nuzzlehouse">their podcast</a>. I am absurdly happy about this.</p>
				
<p>I've finally written a couple of stories I've been meaning to write for a very long time: <a href="the.gift.of.the.influencers.html"><em>The Gift of the Influencers</em></a>, <a href="its.an.ayn.rand.christmas.html"><em>It's an Ayn Rand Christmas</em></a>, and <a href="https://baki.cc/harleys.angels.html"><em>Harleys Angels: The Strange and Terrible Saga of the Middle-Aged Motorcyclist</em></a>.</p>

<p>I've also written oodles about libraries: <a href="evil.tomes.how.to.circulate.your.possessed.book.collection.html"><em>Evil Tomes: How to Circulate Your Possessed Book Collection</em></a>, <a href="the.librarians.of.penzance.html"><em>The Librarians of Penzance</em></a>, <a href="the.notorious.library.hypnotize.html"><em>The Notorious Library: Hypnotize</em></a>, <a href="now.is.the.summer.of.our.discontent.html"><em>Now is the Summer of Our Discontent</em></a>, and <a href="saturday.librarian.html"><em>Saturday Librarian</em></a>.</p>

<p>I've been trying to finish <a href="the.gospel.according.to.matthew.html">my gospel</a> for years.</p>

There's still a bunch of stuff I'd like to write:
<ul>
	<li>A story titled <em>The Ones Who Do Not See</em> based on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130313040347/http://sites.asiasociety.org/asia21summit/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/3.-Le-Guin-Ursula-The-Ones-Who-Walk-Away-From-Omelas.pdf"><em>The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas</em></a> by <a href="https://www.ursulakleguin.com/">Ursula K. Le Guin</a> and <a href="https://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/fiction/the-ones-who-stay-and-fight/"><em>The Ones Who Stay and Fight</em></a> by <a href="https://nkjemisin.com/">N.K. Jemisin</a>.</li>
<li>A magical realism piece set in Lincoln City, Oregon based on the work of <a href="https://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/3196/the-art-of-fiction-no-69-gabriel-garcia-marquez">Gabriel García Márquez</a> and <a href="https://www.welcometonightvale.com/"><em>Welcome to Nightvale</em></a>.</li>
<li>A book of short story horror set in the PNW.</li>
<li><em>Tramping and Vamping - Re: Replacement of the Shoe Covering of the Forefoot, not the Sucking of Blood to Feed The Unholy Undead and not the Use of Seductive Wiles - through Transylvania, Maramures, Crisana and the Romanian Banat</em>.</li>

<p>I've finally succeeded in figuring out how to turn off smart quotes while working on my site in Notepad. Yes, this site has been made in Notepad. Please accept my apologies. All cool hand-coders use Vi or Notepad++ or, I don't know, something better than Notepad. This is okay, though, because I am not cool. But! The smart quotes thing! Smart quotes in Notepad have plagued me for decades. No more! (Ctl+Shift+')</p>

<p>You should in no way read <a href=""><em>John Gall's Speech</em></a>. It is horrible. I'd like to think this is because the source material was so gosh darned awful - and it is - but I have done nothing to improve upon it at all. Not even a little bit. It is rubbish. Sorry.</p>

<p>I am madly, deeply, head-over-heelsy in love.</p>

<p>I believe that <a href="life.the.universe.and.everything.html">people should know how very special they are</a>.</p>

<p>I am a bit of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absurdism">aburdist</a>.</p>
				

<p>I was once called a rainbow alphabet jihadist.</p>
