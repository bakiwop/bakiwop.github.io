<h1 class="enorme">About</h1>

<p>Two quotes from <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093779/"><em>The Princess Bride</em></a> describe me fairly well: No one of consequence. Get used to disappointment.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=tobago+%22relaxed+slow-paced+and+largely+undeveloped%22">This description of Tobago</a> also applies: relaxed, slow-paced, and largely undeveloped.</p>

<p>I had a very short story of mine, <a href="piggly.wiggly.html"><em>Piggly Wiggly</em></a>, <a href="https://nuzzle-house.pinecast.co/episode/49e65cd0/piggly-wiggly-by-anonymous">read by Nuzzle House</a> on <a href="https://linktr.ee/nuzzlehouse">their podcast</a>. I am absurdly happy about this.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_(musician)">Prince</a> said it well in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_St."><em>Alphabet Street</em></a>, "Put the right letters together and make a better day."</p>

<p>I've finally succeeded in figuring out how to turn off smart quotes while working on my site in Notepad. Smart quotes in Notepad have plagued me for decades. No more! (Ctl+Shift+')</p>

<p>I am madly, deeply, head-over-heelsy in love.</p>

<p>I am naught but <a href="cat.html">cat furniture</a>.</p>

<p>I believe that <a href="life.the.universe.and.everything.html">people should know how very special they are</a>.</p>

<p>I am a bit of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absurdism">absurdist</a>.</p>

<p>Â¡Unknown by billions!</p>

<p>I was once called a rainbow alphabet jihadist.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for you, this site has been made in <a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/windows-notepad/9MSMLRH6LZF3">Notepad</a>. Please accept my apologies. All cool hand-coders use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi">Vi</a> or <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a> or, I don't know, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=what's+better+than+notepad">something better than Notepad</a>. And really, who actually hand-codes a website these days anyway?</p>
