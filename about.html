<h1 class="enorme">About</h1>

<p>Two quotes from <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093779/"><em>The Princess Bride</em></a> describe me fairly well: No one of consequence. Get used to disappointment.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=tobago+%22relaxed+slow-paced+and+largely+undeveloped%22">This description of Tobago</a> also applies: relaxed, slow-paced, and largely undeveloped.</p>

<p>I had a very short story of mine, <a href="piggly.wiggly.html"><em>Piggly Wiggly</em></a>, <a href="https://nuzzle-house.pinecast.co/episode/49e65cd0/piggly-wiggly-by-anonymous">read by Nuzzle House</a> on <a href="https://linktr.ee/nuzzlehouse">their podcast</a>. I am absurdly happy about this.</p>

<p>I've finally written a couple of stories I've been meaning to write for a very long time: <a href="the.gift.of.the.influencers.html"><em>The Gift of the Influencers</em></a>, <a href="its.an.ayn.rand.christmas.html"><em>It's an Ayn Rand Christmas</em></a>, and <a href="https://baki.cc/harleys.angels.html"><em>Harleys Angels: The Strange and Terrible Saga of the Middle-Aged Motorcyclist</em></a>.</p>
<p>I've also written oodles about libraries: <a href="evil.tomes.how.to.circulate.your.possessed.book.collection.html"><em>Evil Tomes: How to Circulate Your Possessed Book Collection</em></a>, <a href="the.librarians.of.penzance.html"><em>The Librarians of Penzance</em></a>, <a href="the.notorious.library.hypnotize.html"><em>The Notorious Library: Hypnotize</em></a>, <a href="now.is.the.summer.of.our.discontent.html"><em>Now is the Summer of Our Discontent</em></a>, <a href="saturday.librarian.html"><em>Saturday Librarian</em></a>, <a href="intellectual.freedom.and.holocaust.denial.html"><em>Intellectual Freedom and Holocaust Denial</em></a>, and <a href="library.neutrality.html"><em>Library Neutrality</em></a>.</p>
<p>I've been trying to finish <a href="the.gospel.according.to.matthew.html">my gospel</a> for years.</p>
There's still a bunch of stuff I'd like to write:
<ul>
	<li>A story titled <em>The Ones Who Do Not See</em> based on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130313040347/http://sites.asiasociety.org/asia21summit/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/3.-Le-Guin-Ursula-The-Ones-Who-Walk-Away-From-Omelas.pdf"><em>The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas</em></a> by <a href="https://www.ursulakleguin.com/">Ursula K. Le Guin</a> and <a href="https://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/fiction/the-ones-who-stay-and-fight/"><em>The Ones Who Stay and Fight</em></a> by <a href="https://nkjemisin.com/">N.K. Jemisin</a>.</li>
	<li>A magical realism piece set in Lincoln City, Oregon inspired by the work of <a href="https://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/3196/the-art-of-fiction-no-69-gabriel-garcia-marquez">Gabriel García Márquez</a> and <a href="https://www.welcometonightvale.com/"><em>Welcome to Nightvale</em></a>.</li>
	<li>A book of short story horror set in the PNW.</li>
	<li><em>Tramping and Vamping - Re: Replacement of the Shoe Covering of the Forefoot, not the Sucking of Blood to Feed The Unholy Undead and not the Use of Seductive Wiles - through Transylvania, Maramures, Crisana, and the Romanian Banat</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You should in no way read <a href="john.galls.speech.html"><em>John Gall's Speech</em></a>. It is horrible. I'd like to think this is because the source material was so gosh darned awful - and it is - but I have done nothing to improve upon it at all. Not even a little bit. It is rubbish. Sorry.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_(musician)">Prince</a> said it well in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_St."><em>Alphabet Street</em></a>, "Put the right letters together and make a better day."</p>

<p>I've finally succeeded in figuring out how to turn off smart quotes while working on my site in Notepad. Smart quotes in Notepad have plagued me for decades. No more! (Ctl+Shift+')</p>

<p>I am madly, deeply, head-over-heelsy in love.</p>

<p>I am naught but <a href="cat.html">cat furniture</a>.</p>

<p>I believe that <a href="life.the.universe.and.everything.html">people should know how very special they are</a>.</p>

<p>I am a bit of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absurdism">absurdist</a>.</p>

<p>¡Unknown by billions!</p>

<p>I was once called a rainbow alphabet jihadist.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for you, this site has been made in <a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/windows-notepad/9MSMLRH6LZF3">Notepad</a>. Please accept my apologies. All cool hand-coders use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi">Vi</a> or <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a> or, I don't know, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=what's+better+than+notepad">something better than Notepad</a>. And really, who actually hand-codes a website these days anyway? Sheesh.</p>
