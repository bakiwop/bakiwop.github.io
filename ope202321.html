<a class="titolo" href="#29"><h2 class="enormeday" id="29">29</h2></a>
<p>Today is Great White's ten year anniversary with us. We call her Great White because she's great, she's white, and <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=great+white+sharks+circling&t=ffab&iax=videos&ia=videos">she will circle you over and over again</a> for reasons known only to her.</p>
<p>Great White is a cat. <a href="https://archive.org/details/snoring.3gp">Here's a little vid of her snoring.</a></p>
<p>She's actually 18 1/2 now. This means, of course, that we got her secondhand. That's another nickname for her: Secondhand Cat. Other nicknames include Sweet Pea, Sweetie, Honey Baked, Little One, Fluffy Battle Kitten (stolen from an <a href="https://fluffybattlekitten.com/">old school blogger</a>), Darling, Darling One, Beautiful, Gatta Bianca and Bella Ragazza. Her actual name is Snowflake, which was her name before we met her.</p>
<p>Being 18 1/2, she has many health problems. Two weeks ago we thought we were going to lose her, but our girl is a fighter...always has been. She's tenacious, another nickname for her is Tenacious C. She died once on an operating table about six years ago, turns out she was allergic to the anesthesia they gave her. They came out, told us, then asked us if we wanted them to try and resuscitate her. Our answer was, "Yes, please."</p>
<p>As I said, she has a lot of health issues. She has two vets, one in town where we live and the other at the teaching hospital at the big state university. She's going to see an orthopedist, a cardiologist, and an internal medicine vet. Poor Little One, that's a lot of vet visits. She is not fond of vets. She indicates her lack of fondness through hissing and swiping.</p>
<p>In the ten years she's been a part of the family, she's lived in three different states. She is not fond of travel. The move to the second state was 2000 miles. Poor thing! The move to the third state was only about 300 miles. When I say "part of the family," I do not mean we think of her as our child. She is not our daughter. We are not her mom and dad. She is, however, part of the family.</p>
<p>She's an amazing, wonderful, groovy little thing.</p>
