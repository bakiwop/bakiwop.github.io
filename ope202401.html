<p>I'm not doing the New Year's resolution thing this year. I'd say I'm resolving not to do it but that would be, you know, counterproductive. So instead this year I'm making a New Year's wish. I wish to be absurdly rich, monetarily speaking.</p>
<p>A little self-centered? Perhaps lacking in goodwill toward all? I see how you could come to that conclusion. That's a fair cop. I can dig it. I don't particularly care in this particular instance, but I get it. I figure we've all been making resolutions for decades and, well, the world at a macro level is pretty shit, right? Climate change, housing, wealth disparity, income inequality, wage stagnation, benefits cliffs, Nazis in America, Nazis everywhere else, systemic racism, for-profit healthcare, and, well, the list goes on and on. Every year we get a little closer to death, a little less healthy, a little slower, a little foggier, mentally speaking, and it's just a slow decline toward shuffling off this mortal coil.</p>
<p>I should write Hallmark cards.</p>
<p>So! I figure I should try the New Year's wish thing. Resolutions just mean more work for me and wishing for things like world peace never really pan out, so just give me oodles of dough. Absurd amounts of bucks. It's not even like I want a <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/jeff-bezos-500m-yacht-has-a-246-foot-support-ship-lauren-sanchez-figurehead/ar-AA1brJ4a">second yacht to support my first yacht</a>, a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/dec/21/mark-zuckerberg-apocalypse-bunker-hawaii">bunker fancier than Zuckerberg's</a>, or a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/18/former-ge-ceo-jeff-immelt-used-two-jets-for-business-travel-wsj.html">second private jet to follow around my first private jet</a>. I'd just like to have more money than I know what to do with. The ability to pay for things and buy my way out of any trouble without having to think about it. Not have to put in a forty hour work week...and my job? My job is pretty darned cushy. I get paid a good amount of money to help people every day. It's a plum gig. But I'd still rather not have to spend 40+ hours of my week doing it.</p>
<p>Humans are capable of so much! We have so much creativity and imagination and intelligence and compassion and what do we have to do? Waste most of our lives working full-time. And that's if we're lucky! That's if we're not stitching together three jobs to try to make ends meet or <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-57522186">literally slaving away as a child so people can have Nestl√© chocolate bars</a>. Instead of contributing to society through engineering projects and musical scores and...yeah, I understand that not everyone is going to be a Mozart and someone will have to do actually do important things like building and maintaining infrastructure and collecting trash, but gosh darnit all to heck we are so close to robots being able to do that kind of work anyway.</p>
<p>And yes, I understand you may think I hold the small, foolish beliefs of a child, but to that I just say, "You're a poopyhead."</p>
<p>Why "monetarily speaking?" Let's face it, I'm a straight, able-bodied, white, middle-aged, middle-class, heterosexual, Cis-male in America. I have an amazing wife and an amazing cat, a nice roof over my head, and can still afford to buy groceries. I'm already absurdly rich in many ways. I just need piles of filthy lucre to finish off that bingo card. Since it's the new year now, raise a glass of whatever you're drinking and make a wish for yourself. May you have wealth, prosperity, and abundance - and may I have wads of cash - in the new year.</p>
