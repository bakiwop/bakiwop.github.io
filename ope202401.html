<p>I'm not doing the New Year's resolution thing this year. I'd say I'm resolving not to do it but that would be, you know, counterproductive. So instead this year I'm making a New Year's wish. I wish to be absurdly rich, monetarily speaking.</p>
<p>A little self-centered? Perhaps lacking in goodwill toward all? I see how you could come to that conclusion. That's a fair cop. I can dig it. I don't particularly care in this particular instance, but I get it. I figure we've all been making resolutions for decades and, well, the world at a macro level is pretty shit, right? Climate change, housing, wealth disparity, income inequality, wage stagnation, benefits cliffs, Nazis in America, Nazis everywhere else, systemic racism, for-profit healthcare, and, well, the list goes on and on. Every year we get a little closer to death, a little less healthy, a little slower, a little foggier, mentally speaking, and it's just a slow decline toward shuffling off this mortal coil.</p>
<p>I should write Hallmark cards.</p>
<p>So! I figure I should try the New Year's wish thing. Resolutions just mean more work for me and wishing for things like world peace never really pan out, so just give me oodles of dough. Absurd amounts of bucks. It's not even like I want a <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/jeff-bezos-500m-yacht-has-a-246-foot-support-ship-lauren-sanchez-figurehead/ar-AA1brJ4a">second yacht to support my first yacht</a>, a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/dec/21/mark-zuckerberg-apocalypse-bunker-hawaii">bunker fancier than Zuckerberg's</a>, or a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/18/former-ge-ceo-jeff-immelt-used-two-jets-for-business-travel-wsj.html">second private jet to follow around my first private jet</a>. I'd just like to have more money than I know what to do with. The ability to pay for things and buy my way out of any trouble without having to think about it. Not have to put in a forty hour work week...and my job? My job is pretty darned cushy. I get paid a good amount of money to help people every day. It's a plum gig. But I'd still rather not have to spend 40+ hours of my week doing it.</p>
<p>Humans are capable of so much! We have so much creativity and imagination and intelligence and compassion and what do we have to do? Waste most of our lives working full-time. And that's if we're lucky! That's if we're not stitching together three jobs to try to make ends meet or <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-57522186">literally slaving away as a child so people can have Nestlé chocolate bars</a>. Instead of contributing to society through engineering projects and musical scores and...yeah, I understand that not everyone is going to be a Mozart and someone will have to do actually do important things like building and maintaining infrastructure and collecting trash, but gosh darnit all to heck we are so close to robots being able to do that kind of work anyway.</p>
<p>And yes, I understand you may think I hold the small, foolish beliefs of a child, but to that I just say, "You're a poopyhead."</p>
<p>Why "monetarily speaking?" Let's face it, I'm a straight, able-bodied, white, middle-aged, middle-class, heterosexual, Cis-male in America. I have an amazing wife and an amazing cat, a nice roof over my head, and can still afford to buy groceries. I'm already absurdly rich in many ways. I just need piles of filthy lucre to finish off that bingo card. Since it's the new year now, raise a glass of whatever you're drinking and make a wish for yourself. May you have wealth, prosperity, and abundance - and may I have wads of cash - in the new year.</p>

<p>Took Tenacious C to a cardiology appointment. Last minute cancellation yesterday afternoon for them meant we got the call to fill the spot and take her today. A month earlier than the earliest appointment we could get previously. Yay team.</p>
<p>Little One has a heart murmur. The white coats wanted to see if it was the kind where there were major heart issues or the kind that just meant she's getting older and everything's basically okay. Evidently when kitties have a heart murmur it's a fifty/fifty chance. Thank goodness it was the latter. Slight thickening of the wall in the left ventricle due to age, the doc said. Every time they said "due to age" I wanted to cover Sweet Pea's ears. She'd been drugged, twice, forced to fast since midnight, see a vet, and ride in a car for three hours. That's a very bad day for Gatta Bianca. I figured calling her old over and over again was a bit harsh. The white coats were pretty darned good, though. They almost always are at the <a href="https://vetmed.oregonstate.edu/hospital/">Lois Bates Acheson Veterinary Teaching Hospital</a>.</p>
<p>Now that we're home, Great White is fighting the effects of the sedation drugs she was given. She does this by jumping up onto everything she can then jumping back down again. Little daredevil. When she walks she sometimes missteps, but never when she's jumping. And her monkeys? We threw on <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090728/">Big Trouble in Little China</a>, a movie we haven't sat down to watch in years. Very entertaining.</p>
<blockquote>This is Jack Burton in the Pork Chop Express, and I'm talkin' to whoever's listenin' out there. Just remember what ol' Jack Burton does when the earth quakes, and the poison arrows fall from the sky, and the pillars of Heaven shake. Yeah, Jack Burton just looks that big ol' storm right square in the eye and he says, "Give me your best shot, pal. I can take it."</blockquote>
<p>This is Snowflake on the Oregon Coast, and I'm meowing at whoever's listenin' here. Just remember what ol' Tenacious C does when she car rides, and the vet's poison syringes plunge into her body, and the pillars of heaven shake. Yeah, Great White just looks that big ol' vet right square in the eye and she says, "Give me your best shot, pal. I can take it."</p>

<p>One of the perils of working in a public library is the number of patrons who try to recommend books to you. It's sweet. It's kind. It's thoughtful. It means that you are making a connection with the patron. Making them feel comfortable. This is a good thing. And I wish to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_Spaghetti_Monster#Afterlife">the flying spaghetti monster in beer volcano heaven above</a> that they'd stop.</p>
<p>First of all, being around books and patrons all day, my to-be-read list is already, like, six feet high. There are an ungodly number of books I have yet to get to.</p>
<p>Second, here's the first paragraph from a recommendation from a patron:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>
"Hands on her hips, youthful breasts outthrust beneath the bulk of her red-and-gray sweater, seventeen-year-old Roxanne Brianna O'Brien, captain of the Bisbee High School pep squad, tossed her long blonde hair and led her six-member team in a strutting parade around the end of the football field."
</em></p></blockquote>
<p>That's from <a href="https://search.worldcat.org/search?q=Jance%2C+Judith+A.">JA Jance's</a>, <a href="https://search.worldcat.org/title/37792596"><em>Skeleton Canyon</em></a>, in case your interested in checking it out.</p>
<p>Patrons like all kinds of books and genres. This is wonderful and how things should be. It would be very uncool to make fun of someone for what they read. Jerk move. That being said, when I forget to do my due diligence and just grab a recommended book without vetting it for myself first, it can be awful to discover - once I'm in my comfy chair with my yummy snacks and drinks - that the book is something I have no interest in at all...so I just sit there, the tension in my body making my comfy chair slightly less comfortable, my fizzy yummy drinks slowly going flat and my munchies slowly turning stale, and the book case with all of my old standbys is way over there across the room and WHY IS LIFE SO UNFAIR!!!</p>

<p><a href="https://multcolib.org">Multnomah County Library</a> is the big boy library system in my neck of the woods. There was a recent article on Oregon Public Broadcasting (<a href="https://www.opb.org">OPB</a> for the cool kids) titled, <em><a href="https://www.opb.org/article/2023/12/07/audit-finds-most-multnomah-county-library-staff-feel-unsafe-at-work/">Most Multnomah County library staff feel unsafe at work, audit finds</a></em>.</p>
<blockquote><em>
Overdoses. Stabbings. Sexual harassment. Hate speech. For employees at Multnomah County libraries, workplace concerns go beyond late fees and damaged books.
<br /><br />
An audit of the county’s library system published Thursday found that nearly 75% of surveyed library staff who work directly with the public don’t feel safe at their job. The audit, which reviewed the past two fiscal years, also identified areas in which the library system may be violating Oregon workplace safety rules.
</em></blockquote>
<p>Those things are definitely concerns when working in a public library. Public libraries are for <strong>everyone</strong>. I know you probably think you know what I mean when I say "everyone," but until you actually spend a couple years working in a public library I can pretty much guarantee that you don't grasp how <em>everyone</em> everyone is. All that being said, I gotta tell ya, the hardest thing for me to deal with in public libraries are the smells.</p>
<p>Patrons, may the great library director in the sky never mark them oversuelay their overdue stamp upon them, smell.</p>
<p>But...but...stabbings? Worse than being stabbed? At least if you get stabbed you probably get the rest of the day off, a day now wonderfully free from the smells of patrons.</p>
