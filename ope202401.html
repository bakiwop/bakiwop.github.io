<p>I'm not doing the New Year's resolution thing this year. I'd say I'm resolving not to do it but that would be, you know, counterproductive. So instead this year I'm making a New Year's wish. I wish to be absurdly rich, monetarily speaking.</p>
<p>A little self-centered? Perhaps lacking in goodwill toward all? I see how you could come to that conclusion. That's a fair cop. I can dig it. I don't particularly care in this particular instance, but I get it. I figure we've all been making resolutions for decades and, well, the world at a macro level is pretty shit, right? Climate change, housing, wealth disparity, income inequality, wage stagnation, benefits cliffs, Nazis in America, Nazis everywhere else, systemic racism, for-profit healthcare, and, well, the list goes on and on. Every year we get a little closer to death, a little less healthy, a little slower, a little foggier, mentally speaking, and it's just a slow decline toward shuffling off this mortal coil.</p>
<p>I should write Hallmark cards.</p>
<p>So! I figure I should try the New Year's wish thing. Resolutions just mean more work for me and wishing for things like world peace never really pan out, so just give me oodles of dough. Absurd amounts of bucks. It's not even like I want a <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/jeff-bezos-500m-yacht-has-a-246-foot-support-ship-lauren-sanchez-figurehead/ar-AA1brJ4a">second yacht to support my first yacht</a>, a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/dec/21/mark-zuckerberg-apocalypse-bunker-hawaii">bunker fancier than Zuckerberg's</a>, or a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/18/former-ge-ceo-jeff-immelt-used-two-jets-for-business-travel-wsj.html">second private jet to follow around my first private jet</a>. I'd just like to have more money than I know what to do with. The ability to pay for things and buy my way out of any trouble without having to think about it. Not have to put in a forty hour work week...and my job? My job is pretty darned cushy. I get paid a good amount of money to help people every day. It's a plum gig. But I'd still rather not have to spend 40+ hours of my week doing it.</p>
<p>Humans are capable of so much! We have so much creativity and imagination and intelligence and compassion and what do we have to do? Waste most of our lives working full-time. And that's if we're lucky! That's if we're not stitching together three jobs to try to make ends meet or <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-57522186">literally slaving away as a child so people can have Nestl√© chocolate bars</a>. Instead of contributing to society through engineering projects and musical scores and...yeah, I understand that not everyone is going to be a Mozart and someone will have to do actually do important things like building and maintaining infrastructure and collecting trash, but gosh darnit all to heck we are so close to robots being able to do that kind of work anyway.</p>
<p>And yes, I understand you may think I hold the small, foolish beliefs of a child, but to that I just say, "You're a poopyhead."</p>
<p>Why "monetarily speaking?" Let's face it, I'm a straight, able-bodied, white, middle-aged, middle-class, heterosexual, Cis-male in America. I have an amazing wife and an amazing cat, a nice roof over my head, and can still afford to buy groceries. I'm already absurdly rich in many ways. I just need piles of filthy lucre to finish off that bingo card. Since it's the new year now, raise a glass of whatever you're drinking and make a wish for yourself. May you have wealth, prosperity, and abundance - and may I have wads of cash - in the new year.</p>

<p>Today is <a href="https://introvertedworld.com/world-introvert-day/">World Introvert Day</a>! Introverts of the world unite <span class="slightlysmaller">(while making sure to do so only as long as you're comfortable while giving yourself plenty of recovery time after)</span>!</p>
<p>I was reading up on <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-introverts-corner/200908/introverts-unite-quietly">introversion in <em>Psychology Today</em></a>, in it Sophia Dembling writes, 
<blockquote>
<em>"Introverts often try to push against their nature, having bought into the myth that extroversion is 'better' and that it's the American way."</em>
</blockquote>
</p>
<p>I remember how much I bought into this through my 20s. TV shows, movies, and commercials constantly showed groups of people together having good times at bars, beaches, houses, and night clubs. I almost never saw someone sitting quietly by themself having a good time. The only time I saw someone by themself was when they were sad or sick. I thought I was supposed to go out and do things with others and felt guilty when I didn't. Eventually, of course, it occurred to me that TV shows, movies, and commercials would be pretty boring if they just showed some schlub lying on the couch rereading a Terry Pratchett book and learned to relax about it.</p>  
<p>Let your introvert friends know how much you love and care for them today by not reaching out.</p>

<p>Took Tenacious C to a cardiology appointment. Last minute cancellation yesterday afternoon for them meant we got the call to fill the spot and take her today. A month earlier than the earliest appointment we could get previously. Yay team.</p>
<p>Little One has a heart murmur. The white coats wanted to see if it was the kind where there were major heart issues or the kind that just meant she's getting older and everything's basically okay. Evidently when kitties have a heart murmur it's a fifty/fifty chance. Thank goodness it was the latter. Slight thickening of the wall in the left ventricle due to age, the doc said. Every time they said "due to age" I wanted to cover Sweet Pea's ears. She'd been drugged, twice, forced to fast since midnight, see a vet, and ride in a car for three hours. That's a very bad day for Gatta Bianca. I figured calling her old over and over again was a bit harsh. The white coats were pretty darned good, though. They almost always are at the <a href="https://vetmed.oregonstate.edu/hospital/">Lois Bates Acheson Veterinary Teaching Hospital</a>.</p>
<p>Now that we're home, Great White is fighting the effects of the sedation drugs she was given. She does this by jumping up onto everything she can then jumping back down again. Little daredevil. When she walks she sometimes missteps, but never when she's jumping. And her monkeys? We threw on <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090728/">Big Trouble in Little China</a>, a movie we haven't sat down to watch in years. Very entertaining.</p>
<blockquote>This is Jack Burton in the Pork Chop Express, and I'm talkin' to whoever's listenin' out there. Just remember what ol' Jack Burton does when the earth quakes, and the poison arrows fall from the sky, and the pillars of Heaven shake. Yeah, Jack Burton just looks that big ol' storm right square in the eye and he says, "Give me your best shot, pal. I can take it."</blockquote>
<p>This is Snowflake on the Oregon coast, and I'm meowing at whoever's listenin' here. Just remember what ol' Tenacious C does when she car rides, and the vet's poison syringes plunge into her body, and the pillars of heaven shake. Yeah, Great White just looks that big ol' vet right square in the eye and she says, "Give me your best shot, pal. I can take it."</p>
