The central Oregon coast was mostly spared the so-called “bomb cyclone” that damaged northern California and the Seattle area this week, but that doesn’t mean the late fall storms are over.
<br /><br />
The National Weather Service has issued a high wind watch for the central coast for most of Friday, forecasting that south winds could reach up to 60 mph.

<blockquote>
A High Wind Warning for the coastal headlands and beaches means a
hazardous high wind event is expected or occurring in those areas
along the immediate coast. Many of the headland areas and beaches
are vulnerable to very strong wind gusts that may pose a safety
hazard for individuals or high profile vehicles. The strong winds
may also cause property damage. Sustained wind speeds of at least 40
mph or gusts of 58 mph or more are expected in those areas. Coastal
headlands are characterized by high, rocky shores and steep sea
cliffs.

Winds this strong can make driving difficult, especially for high
profile vehicles. Use extra caution.

<p>This is one of my favorite things that happens every year: the seasonal first declaration of snow emergencies.</p>
<p>I live about 2000 miles away from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minneapolis%E2%80%93Saint_Paul">Twin Cities</a>, but I get a huge grin on my face when the text alerts for Minneapolis and St. Paul come in for the first decently sized snowfall of the year. Yeah, I get text alerts for snow emergencies for a place I don't live. Is that weird? Maybe that's weird.</p>
<p>Though, I'd like to live there. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdqptKU2K0o">Just look at this.</a> Snowfall and a nighttime walk around the city. Perfect.</p>
<p>So when I get those first snow emergency alerts of the season I go to the <a href="https://www.startribune.com/">Star Tribune</a> and <a href="https://www.startribune.com/first-big-snowstorm-of-season-slowing-commute-in-twin-cities-much-of-minnesota/601196704">look up their coverage</a>. I do get a bit frustrated with the media coverage occasionally. Four to six inches does not a snowstorm make. It's a nice snowfall, but it's not a snowstorm. Snowstorm designations should be reserved for double digit snowfalls. Though, to be fair, the reports are calling for four to six inches with this first wave of snow then a second wave of snow bringing even more snowfall, so who knows? Maybe they'll see double digit snowfall? How wonderful!</p>

<blockquote>
Most jobs are inside facilities, where the state’s inmates — who are disproportionately Black — can be sentenced to hard labor and forced to work for free doing everything from mopping floors to laundry. But more than 10,000 inmates have logged a combined 17 million work hours outside Alabama’s prison walls since 2018, for entities like city and county governments and businesses that range from major car-part manufacturers and meat-processing plants to distribution centers for major retailers like Walmart, the AP determined. 
<br /><br />
Many prisoners work 40 hours a week outside their facilities and then get weekend passes, allowing them to go home without any supervision or electronic monitoring. So when prisoners are then told they’re too dangerous to be permanently released, England said, it looks like “another way to create a cheap labor force that is easily exploited and abused.”

<p>I had nightmares last night. First time in I don't even know how long.</p>
<p>Yesterday was a bad day. It would have been my parents' 53rd wedding anniversary. <a href="ope00000.html#0000000001">My father died this year.</a></p>
<p>I wasn't expecting... well... I wasn't expecting it to be this hard this time of year. Then I thought it through: his birthday was on the 3rd of November; Thanksgiving on the 28th; Advent, and boy did my dad love Advent  (my dad was a Roman Catholic priest, ordained in 1960, and, because of quirks of the church, he remained a priest for the rest of his life); Christmas on the 25th; my parents anniversary on the 26th; my wife's and my anniversary on the 30th; New Year's; their only grandchild's birthday on January 14th; and my mom's birthday on the 19th.</p>
<p>When I'm at work in the book mines, I sit at a reference desk, in the middle of the library, for eight hours a day. It's the place in the library I like being best. Being available to patrons all the time is groovy. Except sometimes it isn't. Being a reference librarian is, essentially, a customer service position. The customers are called patrons and I don't have to ask them for money when I serve them, but it's a customer service position.</p>
<p>Most of us have had customer service jobs at one point or other in our life. Imagine yourself at that job, then imagine yourself sitting in the middle of the customers for eight hours a day for fourteen years. It can be stressful sometimes, and, it turns out, when you're unknowingly mourning your dead father is one of those times.</p>
<p>So I'm sitting at the reference desk yesterday - thank goodness it was a slow day - and I start tearing up occasionally - and realize I've been thinking about dad.</p>
<p>Specifically? I was born and raised in Wisconsin, and went to college in (at least, one of the colleges I ended up at was in) the Twin Cities. And after college I moved up there multiple times for jobs. I had girlfriends in Minnesota. I met my wife in St. Paul. Anyway, lots of my life took place there, and it was a five(ish) hour drive between the Cities and home. The number of times my parents took me up there and back - be it for college, or a job, or to help me move to a new apartment was... we'd sometimes end up at a <a href="https://countrykitchenrestaurants.com/">Country Kitchen restaurant</a> in Tomah. It was somewhere around the halfway mark of the trip. Eating out was always a special occasion. It didn't happen much.</p>
<p>It occurred to me that I might never make that trip again. I might end up actually living in the Twin Cities again because my wife and  I love it there, but that five hour trip to Wisconsin wouldn't be a thing anymore. That trip was such a big part of my life for so long. That Tomah stop was such a big part of my life... but my dad is dead and my mom is getting sick of the snow and cold, so even if I were to live in the Twin Cities again, there'd be no reason to make the trip to Wisconsin.</p>
<p>There'd be no family in Wisconsin. No family in the little Wisconsin town I grew up in. We have tons of relatives in Chicago, but nobody in Wisconsin anymore.</p>
<p>No more family drive. No more dad helping me load or unload a U-Haul. No more dad.</p>
<p>No more dad.</p>
<p>And there's nothing to be done about it. No way to fix it.</p>
<p>We had a cat. Snowflake. <a href="ope00000.html#0000000002">She also died this year.</a></p>
<p>So that didn't help with yesterday either.</p>
<p>We never thought of her as a fur baby and we were not her mom and dad, but she absolutely was a part of our family. We loved her. She loved us.<p>
<p>There's a thing with cats sometimes. Even though there's nothing wrong and there are people they love and trust with them they start getting anxious. It doesn't matter if you try to pick them up to calm them down, they just keep getting more anxious and they start looking around for escape routes and they aren't registering much that's happening around them and they start shaking. I think they feel trapped. Then, when you let them go they bolt away. Sometimes they snap out of it right away and other times they go for a lie down in the sun or in a dark, quiet room. Decompressing.</p>
<p>That's how I felt yesterday. I could feel that anxious energy building up in me all afternoon. There was nothing to be done about it. There was nowhere I could go to escape it. I had all these staff members and patrons around me needing help, and because it's a customer service position you smile and joke around, and I kept thinking about my dad. I felt trapped.</p>
<p>I made it through to the end of the day. Hugged my wife when she came to pick me up. Spent the entire evening decompressing. Had nightmares. Woke up this morning feeling... what... less anxious? Annoyed by the nightmares?</p>
<p>I don't feel trapped today, though I am feeling a certain inevitability and confusion of it all. Life, that is.</p>

<p>Forgot to mention, when we got Frango mints (which are gone now, natch) from Macy's <a href="ope00001.html#0000000011">a couple of days ago</a> we went to a mall to do it. <a href="https://reddit.com/r/GenX/comments/1habjdt/im_sorry_for_those_of_you_who_never_got_to/">Malls were the bomb diggity back in the day.</a> So bright and shiny. And conspicuous consumptiony. Book stores, arcades, toy stores, music stores, department stores, movie theaters, food courts, clothing stores, and all manner of huts and kiosks. During the holidays they were decked out.</p>
<p>The Macy's we went to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchor_tenant">anchored</a> a mall. Macy's are supposed to be a bit fancy. A bit upscale. This Macy's was kinda dingy. Not particularly polished. Gag me with a ginsu. The mall looked pretty nice, though, and was decked out for the holidays. Totally bitchin'.</p>
<p>Going to Mt. Hood tomorrow. <a href="https://www.timberlinelodge.com/">Timberline lodge.</a> Middle of last week? 68 inches of snow. Now? 97 inches of snow! <a href="https://giphy.com/clips/storyful-canada-americas-bhangra-music-PLdINfYKoFJre4YZav">Happy snow dance.</a> (The gif is from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@GurdeepPandher">Gurdeep Pandher, a Yukon-based, Bhangra artist and educator</a>).</p>
