The central Oregon coast was mostly spared the so-called “bomb cyclone” that damaged northern California and the Seattle area this week, but that doesn’t mean the late fall storms are over.
<br /><br />
The National Weather Service has issued a high wind watch for the central coast for most of Friday, forecasting that south winds could reach up to 60 mph.

<blockquote>
A High Wind Warning for the coastal headlands and beaches means a
hazardous high wind event is expected or occurring in those areas
along the immediate coast. Many of the headland areas and beaches
are vulnerable to very strong wind gusts that may pose a safety
hazard for individuals or high profile vehicles. The strong winds
may also cause property damage. Sustained wind speeds of at least 40
mph or gusts of 58 mph or more are expected in those areas. Coastal
headlands are characterized by high, rocky shores and steep sea
cliffs.

Winds this strong can make driving difficult, especially for high
profile vehicles. Use extra caution.

<p>Many changes around here layout-wise. I've been wanting to do a journal kinda thing for a while now, but I didn't want to use a CMS, they usually end up breaking (and when that happens, it can be a pain in the butt to fix, or, you lose all your data) and there isn't as much control over the layout (not that this layout is the layout to end all layouts, but I know what most of it does since I coded it myself, and changes are pretty easy). And, let's face it, I'm kinda cheap, so I don't want to pay for web hosting if I don't have to. (Thanks, <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub</a>.) There are aspects of a CMS that I'll miss - all that automated archiving and tagging and commenting sure would be nifty, but, like I said up there at the beginning of this run-on paragraph, all I really want to do is keep a bit of a journal like in the olden days where they wrote with fountain pens on parchment paper by candlelight.</p>

<p>Except I'll be writing with electrons, very 21st century-y, dontcha think?</p>

<p>And all this so that in twenty years I can ask myself, "Hey when exactly was that big blow we had on the coast? You know, when the power didn't actually go out" and then I can scour the archives and <a href="https://baki.cc/ope00001.html#0000000001">find what I'm looking for.</a>.</p>

<p>Exciting stuff.</p>

<p>There'll be some oft-used tags like #backyard, which will be about all the cool things that happen in my backyard; #pnw, which will be the nifty things I experience in the PNW; #ope, which will be about general life-type stuff; #mattifesto, which will be deep thots (to steal a spelling from a cool internet person about two decades ago); #earworm, which will be the songs that get stuck in my head, and, well, I'm sure there'll be others.</p>

<p>So welcome to the madhouse. If you're reading this it must be a mistake. Go outside and play or something.</p>

<p>This is one of my favorite things that happens every year: the seasonal first declaration of snow emergencies.</p>
<p>I live about 2000 miles away from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minneapolis%E2%80%93Saint_Paul">Twin Cities</a>, but I get a huge grin on my face when the text alerts for Minneapolis and St. Paul come in for the first decently sized snowfall of the year. Yeah, I get text alerts for snow emergencies for a place I don't live. Is that weird? Maybe that's weird.</p>
<p>Though, I'd like to live there. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdqptKU2K0o">Just look at this.</a> Snowfall and a nighttime walk around the city. Perfect.</p>
<p>So when I get those first snow emergency alerts of the season I go to the <a href="https://www.startribune.com/">Star Tribune</a> and <a href="https://www.startribune.com/first-big-snowstorm-of-season-slowing-commute-in-twin-cities-much-of-minnesota/601196704">look up their coverage</a>. I do get a bit frustrated with the media coverage occasionally. Four to six inches does not a snowstorm make. It's a nice snowfall, but it's not a snowstorm. Snowstorm designations should be reserved for double digit snowfalls. Though, to be fair, the reports are calling for four to six inches with this first wave of snow then a second wave of snow bringing even more snowfall, so who knows? Maybe they'll see double digit snowfall? How wonderful!</p>

<span class="date"><a class="poundtag" href="ope00001.html#0000000008">The Winter of My Discontent</a></span>
<br />
<span class="pound">#</span><span class="tag">ope</span>
<p>I have a high tolerance for boredom. Always have had. On those exceedingly infrequent occasions when I begin to feel boredom crawling across my brain, moving like a marine layer off the ocean insinuating itself into civilization, creeping amongst the narrow winding roads and cedar-sided cabins on the headlands and promontories bumping up to the sea, well, I know I'm in for a couple hours of happy fun time.</p>
<p>Discontentment.</p>
<p>It usually starts with me wishing I was somewhere else. Oftentimes the <a href="https://www.exploreminnesota.com/minneapolis-st-paul-area/minneapolis-st-paul">Twin Cities</a>, but sometimes its Chicago or New York or London. I've lived in the same town for nearly nine years. Nine years! My wife and I have been together almost 29 years, and in those 29 years we've lived in 23 different places, so to live somewhere for nine years when you're used to moving, on average, more than once a year?</p>
<p>And then I start thinking about the fact that <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/benefits/retirement/planner/1960.html">I have at least 16 more years until official retirement age</a>...and...I picture myself sitting at this same reference desk in this same book mine for <em>sixteen more years</em>. Sixteen! And that's followed immediately by two more thoughts.</p>
<p>1) That'll be what happens <em>if I'm lucky</em>.</p>
<p>2) The retirement age will probably be moved back to 70 or 75 by then.</p>
<p>So, as I'm looking at the absurd price of rentals in my ville du jour, I begin my best Judy Garland impression, reciting the magic words, "There's no place like home," over and again until I believe the truth of the matter: I'm very fortunate. I have an amazing wife. We have a nice house. <a href="vivo.qui.html">We live in a crazy beautiful part of the world.</a> I get paid fairly well to help people. Every day. And I don't have to say to them, 'that'll be $39.99...cash or credit?' when I'm done helping them. I simply get to wish them a good rest of the day and let them get on with their life.</p>
<p>It's good to experience discontentment. Occasionally, anyway. It helps you evaluate your life. It helps remind you of your good fortune.</p>
<p>I still wish I were living in the Cities, though.</p>
