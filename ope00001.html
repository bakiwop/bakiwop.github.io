<blockquote>
The central Oregon coast was mostly spared the so-called “bomb cyclone” that damaged northern California and the Seattle area this week, but that doesn’t mean the late fall storms are over.
<br /><br />
The National Weather Service has issued a high wind watch for the central coast for most of Friday, forecasting that south winds could reach up to 60 mph.

<blockquote>
A High Wind Warning for the coastal headlands and beaches means a
hazardous high wind event is expected or occurring in those areas
along the immediate coast. Many of the headland areas and beaches
are vulnerable to very strong wind gusts that may pose a safety
hazard for individuals or high profile vehicles. The strong winds
may also cause property damage. Sustained wind speeds of at least 40
mph or gusts of 58 mph or more are expected in those areas. Coastal
headlands are characterized by high, rocky shores and steep sea
cliffs.

Winds this strong can make driving difficult, especially for high
profile vehicles. Use extra caution.

  rocks and jetties and drown while observing high surf. Minor
  beach erosion may damage coastal properties and buildings.
  Higher than normal water run-up is expected on beaches and

<br />
<p>The Republican Party and the Democratic Party are both stinkers. There is no lesser evil. They are both evil. We keep letting them tell us the other party is the problem. The problem is that we believe that. The problem is that we should be keeping our parties honest, not blaming the other parties.</p>
<p>The other problem? The two-party system bites. Hard.</p>
<p>But back to the <a href="https://gop.com/">RNC</a> and the <a href="https://democrats.org/">DNC</a>.</p>
<p>Anyone who follows the likes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Trump</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_McConnell">McConnell</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Abbott">Abbott</a> needs a hug.

A lot of hugs. All the Democratic National Committee cares about is money and power.</p>
Don't think they're the same? You're right, they're not exactly the same. <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/watch-trump-praises-heart-and-strength-of-supreme-court-for-overturning-roe-v-wade">Republicans took away abortion rights.</a> <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/10/fact-check-obamas-misleading-answer-about-warrantless-wiretapping-daily-show">Democrats greatly increased the use of electronic warrantless wiretapping.</a> Sometimes the Republicans give; sometimes they take. Sometimes the democrats give; sometimes they take.</p>
<p>But mostly? The RNC and the DNC take. And there's blood on their hands. Lots of blood today. Lots of blood going way back.</p>
<p>Here's some other examples:</p>

<p>What it comes down to: What's above isn't even the tip of the iceberg. Stop giving money to the DNC and RNC - two private corporations who can do pretty much whatever they want. Give money directly to candidates you believe in...and there are (and were) politicians to believe in (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria_Ocasio-Cortez">AOC</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Sanders">Bernie Sanders</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashida_Tlaib">Rashida Tlaib</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pramila_Jayapal">Pramila Jayapal</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Warren">Elizabeth Warren</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russ_Feingold">Russ Feingold</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Wellstone">Paul Wellstone</a> to name a few.</p>

<p>Watched <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0348034">Season 01 Episode 01 of The Simpsons</a> last night. Titled, "Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire." I'd forgotten how 80s it felt. Kinda neat. Gonna watch a couple more Simpsons christmas episodes today. Also watched <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096061/">Scrooged</a>. Favorite line from a christmas movie? <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096061/quotes/?item=qt0266427&ref_=ext_shr_lnk">"Bitch hit me with a toaster."</a> <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001406">Carol Kane</a> was fabulous. So was <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0423774">David Johansen</a>.</p>
<p>The smell of christmas dinner has filled the house, the comfy chair is supremely comfortable, there's a fire going, and Frowzy Du tops the tree. Seasons greetings.</p>
