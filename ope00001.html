<blockquote>
The central Oregon coast was mostly spared the so-called “bomb cyclone” that damaged northern California and the Seattle area this week, but that doesn’t mean the late fall storms are over.
<br /><br />
The National Weather Service has issued a high wind watch for the central coast for most of Friday, forecasting that south winds could reach up to 60 mph.

<p>7th grade basketball game. Player steps on my foot. Pain is so bad I sit in closest stands and cry. For two hours. In my uniform. Nobody comes to help until my parents pick me up. X-ray shows multiple metatarsal fractures.</p>

<blockquote>
A High Wind Warning for the coastal headlands and beaches means a
hazardous high wind event is expected or occurring in those areas
along the immediate coast. Many of the headland areas and beaches
are vulnerable to very strong wind gusts that may pose a safety
hazard for individuals or high profile vehicles. The strong winds
may also cause property damage. Sustained wind speeds of at least 40
mph or gusts of 58 mph or more are expected in those areas. Coastal
headlands are characterized by high, rocky shores and steep sea
cliffs.

Winds this strong can make driving difficult, especially for high
profile vehicles. Use extra caution.

<p>Ha ha! Mattifesto! Get it? Not manifesto; Mattifesto.</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah. Okay.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/manifesto">A manifesto is a "written statement declaring publicly the intentions, motives, or views of its issuer,"</a> so this Mattifesto is <em>my</em> "written statement declaring publicly intentions, motives, or views."</p>
<p>You can pretty much just start most every paragraph that'll be here with "I think…" because that's what this is, just me doing a (very) little bit of thinking about things: what we might be doing wrong, what we might need to start doing right, what we're already doing right, and, well, whatever else might occur to me to "declare publicly."</p>
<!--
<p>What it all comes down to? A brief prelude, perhaps?</p>
<p>We're destroying ourselves. Large, like, really large, like, immense numbers of people are being left behind, and they're falling further behind every day. The more people that are left behind the worse it is for all of us.</p>
<p>This is bad.</p>
<p>We need to love each other. Yes, that includes the "love your enemy" kinda love. No, that doesn't include the "turn the other cheek" kinda love. I'm talking about caring enough about people to leave them an out. To give them space to learn. To not corner them and leave them only with so much hatred that even when they do realize how wrong they are all they feel they can do is double down on that hatred. I'm also talking about caring enough about yourself to realize what you can and can't do for yourself and others in this world...and gosh, that's tough.</p>
<p>Yes, you should probably punch a nazi. And yes, you should offer them a hug when they they realize how bad a person they've been.</p>
<p>We're destroying our ability to live on this planet. No, we won't destroy the planet. The planet and some kind of life will be here long after we're gone. Yes, we are making it harder for us to live well on planet earth, and it's the only place we have to, you know, live.</p>
<p>Capitalism? Bad. In America, the Republicans and Democrats? Bad. Yes, it's "both parties." Money, the way it is used today? Bad. Corporations are not people. Corporate welfare? Bad. And sometimes necessary. But mostly bad. Food? Shelter? Education? Healthcare? Should be much lower cost than we make it and be provided, when necessary, by society. Professional and collegiate sports? Bad. And good. Most sporting regulatory bodies? FIFA? IOC? NFL? Others? Bad.</p>
<p>Institutional inequities exist. Racism. Classism. Built in prejudices of all types that effect lots of folk in ways large and small every day.</p>
<p>I believe people need more hugs. No, I don't want to be the one to provide them. Yes, I'd probably do it, though.</p>
<P>I would also like to point out that I do many of the things that I claim to be bad here. Mea maxima culpa for much of this stuff. I certainly ain't perfect.</p>
