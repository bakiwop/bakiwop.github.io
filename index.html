				<p>In the 1890s, it was a popular spot to take a dip in the Mississippi River in summer and home to curling rinks in winter.</p>
				<p>Later, it was the site of a U.S. Navy training base. Its historic boat club housed a series of nightclubs with colorful names: Tugboat Annie’s, Golden Garter, River Serpent.</p>

			<blockquote>A part of keeping "peace" means stopping violence. Nazism is an inherently violent ideology. Organizing under Nazi ideology is an act of preparation for mass violence. Stopping Nazi's is done in the name of peace. Sometimes when people are violent, you have to use violence to stop them, in the name of peace. Just like we did in World War 2.

				<p>There is no paradox of tolerance in the first place.</p>
				<p>The paradox is resolved by treating tolerance not as a moral precept (<em>something that is done because doing otherwise makes you a bad person</em>, something that must always be done) but as a contract or treaty (something that is reciprocal, the benefits of which you are not obligated to afford to those who do not reciprocally offer those same benefits to you and others in return.) Treaties/contracts come with restrictions which signatories are obligated to follow, and benefits those signatories receive in return. </p>
				<p>Those who refuse to tolerate others who are not impeding anyones rights are not entitled to our tolerance.</p>

		<p>My wife is very into hockey (she's from Minnesota, dontchaknow) and just told me this: <a href="https://apnews.com/article/wild-kirill-kaprizov-contract-df38df3d649600ff7d953da19ac8acbb">Minnesota Wild sign Kirill Kaprizov to richest deal in NHL history: $136 million over 8 years</a>.</p>
		<p>My first thought? I'm not sure I would trade 8 years of my life for $136 million.</p>
		<p>Which just goes to show what a dumbass I am.</p>
		<p>My instincts tell me to say no (and I don't seem to be paying attention to the more logical parts of my brain (which is, usually, par for the course)).</p>
		<p>Just colossal dumbassery on my part.</p>
		<p>But no matter which way I look at it, if my current job - and let me tell you I have a pretty plum gig - offered me $136 million to stay for eight more years? I'd say no.<sup>1</sup></p>
		<p>It just feels wrong.</p>
		<p>It doesn't matter that I would still be below retirement age at the end of the 8 year contract and could retire early. It doesn't matter that I would make roughly $136 million more dollars for 8 years of work than if I worked those same 8 years at my current (with step increases) salary. It doesn't matter that I would be <em>lucky</em> - oh so very lucky - to be able to keep my job for the next 8 years at all.</p>
		<p>None of that matters.</p>
		<p>What seems to matter? I don't know. But good for Kaprizov. He seems smarter than me. And richer. Younger. More athletic. Probably nicer. And? And my wife is very happy that he'll be playing for the Wild.</p>
		<br />
		<p><sup>1</sup>My wife, god bless her, would soon set me straight, though.</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>The “debate me bro” playbook is simple and effective: demand that serious people engage with your conspiracy theories or extremist talking points. If they decline, cry “censorship!” and claim they’re “afraid of the truth.” If they accept, turn the interaction into a performance designed to generate viral clips and false legitimacy. It’s a heads-I-win-tails-you-lose proposition that has nothing to do with genuine intellectual discourse.</p>
			<p>The fundamental issue with “debate me bro” culture isn’t just that it’s obnoxious, it’s that it creates a false equivalence between good-faith expertise and bad-faith trolling. When you agree to debate someone pushing long-debunked conspiracy theories or openly hateful ideologies, you’re implicitly suggesting that their position deserves equal consideration alongside established facts and expert analysis.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<blockquote>
			<p>Perhaps most insidiously, these aren’t actually debates at all. They’re performances designed to generate specific emotional reactions for viral distribution. Participants aren’t trying to persuade anyone or genuinely engage with opposing viewpoints. They’re trying to create moments that will get clipped, shared, and monetized across social media.</p>
			<p>Kirk perfected this grift. As a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn0_2iACV-A">recent detailed analysis of one of Kirk’s debates</a> demonstrates, when a student showed up prepared with nuanced, well-researched arguments, Kirk immediately tried pivoting to culture war talking points and deflection tactics. When debaters tried to use Kirk’s own standards against him, he shifted subjects entirely. The goal was never understanding or persuasion—it was generating content for social media distribution.</p>
