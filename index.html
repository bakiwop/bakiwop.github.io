<p>There was a kid I'd gone to grade school and high school with who died of cancer. He died our junior year. I'll never forget what he told me in fifth grade. He said, "The sound farts make comes from your butt cheeks flapping."</p>
<p>Thanks, Perry, I've never forgotten that.</p>

<p>In high school, my best friend and I used to go to the movies a couple of times a month. How often depended on how much walkin' around cash we had on us. At the theater, I'd always get a big buttery popcorn and soda pop.</p>
<p>Cuz yum.</p>
<p>Once, as I went through my wallet to pay for the concessions, a small piece of paper with a phone number fell out and landed on the glass counter top...you know, the one where you could look down and see all the candy to buy.</p>
<p>I used to love me some junior mints.</p>
<p>Anyway, I did not notice the piece of paper fall out of my wallet. It seems, though, that my friend and the staff member helping us - a girl about our age - had.</p>
<p>She made change and handed it to me. I put the change in my wallet then noticed the piece of paper. I grabbed it and put it back in my wallet.</p>
<p>My friend said, "Huh, I thought you were trying to give her," he said pointing to my wallet, "your phone number."</p>
<p>The girl said, "Me, too."</p>
<p>I grabbed the piece of paper, showed it to them, and said, "It's just the phone number for my parents' car insurance."</p>
<p>I'd gotten my first speeding ticket recently.</p>
<p>As I tucked the piece of paper away, I looked at the girl and said, "I can give you my number if you want."</p>
<p>After a mildly disgusted, "No," she walked away.</p>
<p>I grabbed my popcorn and soda pop. Wish I could remember what the movie was.</p>

<p>The most difficult part of working in a public library is the smells. This is something that is not covered in any <a href="https://www.ala.org/educationcareers/accreditedprograms/guidelines-choosing-masters-program-library-and-information-studies">MLIS program</a>. Nostrils beware.</p>

<p>To cure hiccups, get a glass of water and a pen or pencil. Place the pen or pencil inside your mouth and lightly bite down on it. Drink the glass of water.</p>
<p>This may be a tad messy.</p>
<p>Remove pen or pencil from  mouth. Enjoy your hiccup-free existence.</p>
<p>Bonus points: To avoid potential gastric distress, wash the pen or pencil before you place it in your mouth.</p>
<p>Unless you're into that sorta thing.</p>
<p>I do not judge.</p>

<p>I am madly, deeply, head-over-heelsy in love.</p>
