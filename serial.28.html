		<p>We had the first sneaker wave warning of the season over the weekend. Seas were rough and beaches were dangerous. We had some big wave surfers out there doing their thing about 100 yards from shore. Never seen them that close before. The waves were so big and the sea was so gnarly that they had a wave runner towing people into the waves and out of the surf.</p>
		<p>Stacy and I went for a <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Lincoln+City,+OR/Tillamook,+OR/Timber,+OR/Mist/Jewell,+OR/Astoria,+OR/Lincoln+City,+OR/@46.0620477,-123.8623194,39149m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m44!4m43!1m5!1m1!1s0x54ea8d760b76bd77:0x71530e6a7d2ce862!2m2!1d-124.0159354!2d44.9620902!1m5!1m1!1s0x5494d505a0a0fd65:0x3428344b984d4fd3!2m2!1d-123.8440137!2d45.4562158!1m5!1m1!1s0x5494e5a1524ec1e1:0x1df48d08327d929d!2m2!1d-123.2955437!2d45.7198097!1m5!1m1!1s0x549461c2033693e1:0x938b5587d6febfd0!2m2!1d-123.2565078!2d45.9962223!1m5!1m1!1s0x5494920050878d5b:0xcfdecb947659c44d!2m2!1d-123.5040143!2d45.9345557!1m5!1m1!1s0x54937b440995fb8b:0xf7dd72f1a11b8abf!2m2!1d-123.8312534!2d46.1878841!1m5!1m1!1s0x54ea8d760b76bd77:0x71530e6a7d2ce862!2m2!1d-124.0159354!2d44.9620902!3e0?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MTAxNC4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D">nice leaf peeping drive</a> yesterday. Sunny all the way to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astoria,_Oregon">Astoria.</a> Saw some nice Fall foliage. (On the coast itself leaves either stay green and fall off the few deciduous trees around or turn brown then fall off the few deciduous trees around. Not pretty. But go a mile or to inland and the leaves start popping!) Ate at our favorite place in Astoria, <a href="https://www.friteandscoop.com/">Frites and Scoop</a> (though <a href="https://astoriabrewingcompany.com/">Astoria  Brewing Company</a> is a close second) then hit Costco and drove home in the gray, rainy Oregon Coast weather.</p>
		<p>Went to <a href="https://tormentedillusion.com/">a haunted house</a> on Friday with a couple friends. Haven't been to one in a couple decades. It was fun! They did a great job putting it on. Last time I went to a haunted house I was in my early 20s. Stacy had to work and the couple I went with got in a fight and left, so I tagged along with this young mother and her kids. When we finished she asked if I had been scared. I said no. Then she asked why I had been holding onto her jacket so much. Busted!</p>
		<p>Short work week coming up. Took a couple days off. Yay me.</p>
