<p>In high school, my best friend and I used to go to the movies a couple of times a month. How often depended on how much walkin' around cash we had on us. At the theater, I'd always get a big buttery popcorn and soda pop.</p>
<p>Cuz yum.</p>
<p>Once, as I went through my wallet to pay for the concessions, a small piece of paper with a phone number fell out and landed on the glass counter top...you know, the one where you could look down and see all the candy to buy.</p>
<p>I used to love me some junior mints.</p>
<p>Anyway, I did not notice the piece of paper fall out of my wallet. It seems, though, that my friend and the staff member helping us - a girl about our age - had.</p>
<p>She made change and handed it to me. I put the change in my wallet then noticed the piece of paper. I grabbed it and put it back in my wallet.</p>
<p>My friend said, "Huh, I thought you were trying to give her," he said pointing to my wallet, "your phone number."</p>
<p>The girl said, "Me, too."</p>
<p>I grabbed the piece of paper, showed it to them, and said, "It's just the phone number for my parents' car insurance."</p>
<p>I'd gotten my first speeding ticket recently.</p>
<p>As I tucked the piece of paper away, I looked at the girl and said, "I can give you my number if you want."</p>
<p>After a mildly disgusted, "No," she walked away.</p>
<p>I grabbed my popcorn and soda pop. Wish I could remember what the movie was.</p>
