<p>Stacy thought she'd celebrate the new year by doing the polar bear plunge thing. Except we live on the Oregon Coast, so it's cold and rainy and windy but not snowy or icy. It was held in the bay. The air temp was 41°F. The water temp was around 47°F. She, and a bunch of other folk, ran from the beach into the water. The seals stopped "sunning" themselves on the spit across the bay and swam over to see what the primates were up to. She's a fresh water gal, never been in saltwater before. When she dunked herself her mouth was open. Saltwater is grody. She had such a great time she went back in for a second round. Two friends did it with her. I and a husband of one of the others guarded the warm clothes and took lots of pics. It was an official kinda thing put on by the rec center. Over 400 people attended.</p>
<p>The rest of the day was spent snuggling in the big chair and watching old episodes of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Due_South">Due South</a>. Good way to ring in the new year.</p>
<p>We went to Timberline Lodge for our 29th anniversary. Have to write it up. <a href="ope00002.html#0000000001">It will live here when I get it up.</a></p>

I've worked for the Washington Post since 2008 as an editorial cartoonist. I have had editorial feedback and productive conversations—and some differences—about cartoons I have submitted for publication, but in all that time I’ve never had a cartoon killed because of who or what I chose to aim my pen at. Until now.
<br /><br />
The cartoon that was killed criticizes the billionaire tech and media chief executives who have been doing their best to curry favor with incoming President-elect Trump. There have been multiple articles recently about these men with lucrative government contracts and an interest in eliminating regulations making their way to Mar-a-lago. The group in the cartoon included Mark Zuckerberg/Facebook & Meta founder and CEO, Sam Altman/AI CEO, Patrick Soon-Shiong/LA Times publisher, the Walt Disney Company/ABC News, and Jeff Bezos/Washington Post owner.

	<p>A patron told me that all people resemble flowers and I'm a daisy.</p>
	<p>According to the <a href="https://extension.psu.edu/programs/master-gardener/counties/luzerne/news/2021/april-birth-flower-english-daisy-bellis-perennis">Penn State Extension Master Gardener Program</a>:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>...the daisy conveys many meanings—innocence, simplicity, childlike joy and playfulness, happiness, good luck, new beginnings, loyal love, and purity. It is a flower given between friends to keep a secret; the daisy means "I'll never tell."  Daisies are presented to new mothers, representing fertility and motherhood.</p>
			<p>According to Roman mythology the daisy also symbolizes chastity, modesty, and transformation. This meaning is derived from the story of Vertumnus, the god of seasons who loved a nymph, Belides. He pursued her to the point where she transformed herself into a daisy to escape his unwanted attention. The daisy's Latin name "Bellis" or "Bellus" is derived from Belides and means pretty. The species name "perennis" means lasting through the year.</p>
			<p>Although admired for its many positive attributes, Bellis perennis, has a mixed reputation. Depending on personal experience, it can be an attractive low-spreading ornamental flower enhancing borders, rock gardens or containers. By contrast, it may be a common, persistent weed of lawns, fields and abandoned areas.  The daisy has naturalized in parts of the northern United States and its introduction to non-native environments has made it an aggressive species, which can be difficult to control or eliminate.</p>

<p>Sick day yesterday taking care of Stacy. I was to be the driver should she have needed to go to the hospital. Neither of us thought she would need to go to the hospital, but since we're not medical professionals we thought we'd both take a day off just in case. You know, you can't be too careful with these things</p>
<p>Well, okay. Stacy is a medical professional. But still.</p>
<p>She started feeling better late morning. We watched a billion or so episodes of Kim's Convenience (<a href="https://search.worldcat.org/title/973558990">worldcat link to season 01</a>). Great show. Lotta fun.</p>
<p>We have both decided we need to win the lottery. Immediately. This working forty hours per week thing is a buncha hooey.</p>
<p>Hooey, I tells ya! Hooey!</p>
<p>It doesn't have to be the lottery, of course. We'd just like to be wealthy beyond the need to work and the concern over how much money we spend. Simple enough request, really. Just a couple hundred million. Not sure why it hasn't happened yet. There'll probably be a #mattifesto post about it sometime in the future.</p>

Keith Rosson writes like fire. When reading, I usually just want to see the what happens next so I end up skimming some pages. When reading *this* book, I still just wanted to see what happens next, but I couldn't skim because he writes so gosh darned well. The jerk.

And, kinda nifty, Stacy and I got into the acknowledgments for this one.<br /><br />

<p>The PNW is a pretty funky place to live. The Oregon Coast doubly so.</p>
<p>There's the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_Coast_Range">Oregon Coast Range</a> which butts right up against the Pacific Ocean. It frequently hails. It frequently rains when it's sunny. This leads to oodles of rainbows. Moss and molds abound. Deciduous trees are never bare and brown. If there aren't leaves on them there's moss. Lots of moss.</p>
<p>Fungi also abound. Mushrooms grow everywhere.<p>
<p>The temperature generally stays between forty and seventy degrees fahrenheit. It rarely snows. When it does it doesn't stick around long. It's a wet cold. This makes it feel much colder than it is. We're used to the dry colds back home. The moisture means hair is flat.</p>
<p>There's a lot of salt in the air. Every couple of months we need to wash the house down to get the salt (and keep the moss) off. If cars are left outside surface rust happens very quickly. Keeping them in a garage seems to ameliorate this issue.</p>
<p>There doesn't seem to be a level place in the joint. Hills up the wazoo. It's a good thing it rarely gets cold enough for water to freeze because with all the water we get around here and all the hills we have, driving or biking or walking would be difficult.</p>
<p>It really does rain a lot. Heavy rains abound. Winds blow and gust hard, well into the double digits. When the winds blow and the rain thunders down...it's some nice moody weather. There are all kinds of lights rains, too. There is little lightning and thunder.</p>
<p>All this is mostly true for the first 1/4 to 1/2 mile of land from the ocean. While much of it rings true for the rest of the Coastal Range as well, there are differences. For instance, it can get much warmer there in the summer and much snowier in the winter.</p>

<p>A couple few months ago I had a revelation. I was talking with my wife. I told her the world was a horrible place and I was going to be... and then there was a mental blur, a shift, a kind of visual sound? What I was going to say was "sad for the rest of my life." What I actually said was that I was going to try and live with as much lightheartedness as I could.</p>
<p>It had been a rough couple of years: COVID, the death of Stacy's mom, a brief stint in the antiracism trenches, putting down Sweet Pea, the death of my father, the aches that seem to settle in so easily with older age, the types of "leaders" we elect for ourselves, the insanity of capitalism, the absurdity of founding a country on a constitution drafted by monied white men for monied white men. I was done. Stick a fork in me. And when I was about to say "sad" I had that moment and thought of how unfair that would be to my wife and myself. How cruel a life that would be for us.</p>
<p>I flipped my thinking nearly instantaneously. Yes, <a href="life.the.universe.and.everything.html">we may be amazing, improbable, incredible creatures</a> but we make existence almost completely unbearable for ourselves. The key to surviving it all? Lean into the absurdity. Smile more. Love.</p>

<p>Always weird when I have a Sunday/Monday off of work. Yesterday we went to Newport, OR's Nye Beach, a trendy little area with lots of shops and restaurants and art galleries. It's cool because it has narrow streets and the shops are all right up against each other and there are hidden alleys and sidewalks everywhere. When we moved out here, we wanted to live there, but could only just barely make the rent and then there'd have been a 30 to 60 minute commute for me over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Foulweather">Cape Foulweather</a> (lives up to its name) through tourist traffic every day. Blech.</p>
<p>Head west for a couple of blocks and you end up at the Pacific Ocean (of course). The beaches in Newport are very different from the beaches in Lincoln City (which are different from the beaches in Manzanita and Waldport and Yachats and Florence and Seaside and you get the picture). It was something I never thought about until I experienced it, but each town on the coast has it's own vibe and landscape.</p>
<p>We tried going whale watching today in Depoe Bay. We thought, "it's Monday, all the tourists went home," so it'd be dead and we could enjoy the nice waves and whales spouts. We were wrong. It's King Tides here. (I'll try to track down an old page I made about king tides a while back. <a href="ope00000-9.html">Here it is.</a> So Depoe Bay was packed full of folk and we decided to go whale watching another time.</p>

<p>Work, which is still going to go on for another 90 minutes by the way, has been hectic. The first half of the day was interaction after interaction. That can get tiring - each patron with a small, unique problem that needs attention with the occasional biggie thrown in for good measure. It's also harder, of course, when I want to write and actually have to, like, do my job instead. Woe to me!</p>
<p>Got to see Stacy, though, so that's alright. She came to work with me this morning and stayed for a while then this afternoon she stopped by for a little kiss on her way home from working out, so that's alright, too.</p>
<p>Feels a bit on the cold side today: 50 degrees Fahrenheit with a small breeze from the north, and even though the wind is from the north we're somehow getting a bit of wildfire smoke smell from <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2025/01/los-angeles-wildfire-altadena-octavia-butler/">the fires down in California</a>. We're also going to have lows in the 30s all week.</p>
