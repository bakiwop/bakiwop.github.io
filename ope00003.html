<p>Stacy thought she'd celebrate the new year by doing the polar bear plunge thing. Except we live on the Oregon Coast, so it's cold and rainy and windy but not snowy or icy. It was held in the bay. The air temp was 41°F. The water temp was around 47°F. She, and a bunch of other folk, ran from the beach into the water. The seals stopped "sunning" themselves on the spit across the bay and swam over to see what the primates were up to. She's a fresh water gal, never been in saltwater before. When she dunked herself her mouth was open. Saltwater is grody. She had such a great time she went back in for a second round. Two friends did it with her. I and a husband of one of the others guarded the warm clothes and took lots of pics. It was an official kinda thing put on by the rec center. Over 400 people attended.</p>
<p>The rest of the day was spent snuggling in the big chair and watching old episodes of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Due_South">Due South</a>. Good way to ring in the new year.</p>
<p>We went to Timberline Lodge for our 29th anniversary. Have to write it up. <a href="ope00002.html#0000000001">It will live here when I get it up.</a></p>

Fun characters. Neat story. It's 500 pages. About 200 pages too many. Did some skimming. Don't feel I missed anything important. It's an immersive world and all that world building isn't always my thing. Wasn't my thing this time around.</p>

Great writing. Interesting monster. About 2/3rds of the way through I started skimming the interactions between the four friends. Too much repetition of the same frailties/insecurities/friends great/friends hurt.

Premise was interesting. Writing was pretty good. Way too much macho underworld bro code kinda stuff. Stopped reading on the 9th page.

<blockquote>
I've worked for the Washington Post since 2008 as an editorial cartoonist. I have had editorial feedback and productive conversations—and some differences—about cartoons I have submitted for publication, but in all that time I’ve never had a cartoon killed because of who or what I chose to aim my pen at. Until now.
<br /><br />
The cartoon that was killed criticizes the billionaire tech and media chief executives who have been doing their best to curry favor with incoming President-elect Trump. There have been multiple articles recently about these men with lucrative government contracts and an interest in eliminating regulations making their way to Mar-a-lago. The group in the cartoon included Mark Zuckerberg/Facebook & Meta founder and CEO, Sam Altman/AI CEO, Patrick Soon-Shiong/LA Times publisher, the Walt Disney Company/ABC News, and Jeff Bezos/Washington Post owner.

<br />
<span class="pound">#</span><span class="tag">library</span>
	<p>A patron told me that all people resemble flowers and I'm a daisy.</p>
	<p>According to the <a href="https://extension.psu.edu/programs/master-gardener/counties/luzerne/news/2021/april-birth-flower-english-daisy-bellis-perennis">Penn State Extension Master Gardener Program</a>:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>...the daisy conveys many meanings—innocence, simplicity, childlike joy and playfulness, happiness, good luck, new beginnings, loyal love, and purity. It is a flower given between friends to keep a secret; the daisy means "I'll never tell."  Daisies are presented to new mothers, representing fertility and motherhood.</p>
			<p>According to Roman mythology the daisy also symbolizes chastity, modesty, and transformation. This meaning is derived from the story of Vertumnus, the god of seasons who loved a nymph, Belides. He pursued her to the point where she transformed herself into a daisy to escape his unwanted attention. The daisy's Latin name "Bellis" or "Bellus" is derived from Belides and means pretty. The species name "perennis" means lasting through the year.</p>
			<p>Although admired for its many positive attributes, Bellis perennis, has a mixed reputation. Depending on personal experience, it can be an attractive low-spreading ornamental flower enhancing borders, rock gardens or containers. By contrast, it may be a common, persistent weed of lawns, fields and abandoned areas.  The daisy has naturalized in parts of the northern United States and its introduction to non-native environments has made it an aggressive species, which can be difficult to control or eliminate.</p>

<p>Sick day yesterday taking care of Stacy. I was to be the driver should she have needed to go to the hospital. Neither of us thought she would need to go to the hospital, but since we're not medical professionals we thought we'd both take a day off just in case. You know, you can't be too careful with these things</p>
<p>Well, okay. Stacy is a medical professional. But still.</p>
<p>She started feeling better late morning. We watched a billion or so episodes of Kim's Convenience (<a href="https://search.worldcat.org/title/973558990">worldcat link to season 01</a>). Great show. Lotta fun.</p>
<p>We have both decided we need to win the lottery. Immediately. This working forty hours per week thing is a buncha hooey.</p>
<p>Hooey, I tells ya! Hooey!</p>
<p>It doesn't have to be the lottery, of course. We'd just like to be wealthy beyond the need to work and the concern over how much money we spend. Simple enough request, really. Just a couple hundred million. Not sure why it hasn't happened yet. There'll probably be a #mattifesto post about it sometime in the future.</p>
