<p>Stacy thought she'd celebrate the new year by doing the polar bear plunge thing. Except we live on the Oregon Coast, so it's cold and rainy and windy but not snowy or icy. It was held in the bay. The air temp was 41°F. The water temp was around 47°F. She, and a bunch of other folk, ran from the beach into the water. The seals stopped "sunning" themselves on the spit across the bay and swam over to see what the primates were up to. She's a fresh water gal, never been in saltwater before. When she dunked herself her mouth was open. Saltwater is grody. She had such a great time she went back in for a second round. Two friends did it with her. I and a husband of one of the others guarded the warm clothes and took lots of pics. It was an official kinda thing put on by the rec center. Over 400 people attended.</p>
<p>The rest of the day was spent snuggling in the big chair and watching old episodes of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Due_South">Due South</a>. Good way to ring in the new year.</p>
<p>We went to Timberline Lodge for our 29th anniversary. Have to write it up. <a href="ope00002.html#0000000001">It will live here when I get it up.</a></p>

Fun characters. Neat story. It's 500 pages. About 200 pages too many. Did some skimming. Don't feel I missed anything important. It's an immersive world and all that world building isn't always my thing. Wasn't my thing this time around.</p>

<p><strong>Finished <a href="https://search.worldcat.org/title/1107444635">The Return</a> by <a href="https://www.rachel-harrison.com/">Rachel Harrison</a>.</strong>
<br />
Great writing. Interesting monster. About 2/3rds of the way through I started skimming the interactions between the four friends. Too much repetition of the same frailties/insecurities/friends great/friends hurt.
</p>
<p><strong>Did not finish <a href="https://search.worldcat.org/title/48241359">The 25th Hour</a> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Benioff">David Benioff</a>.</strong>
<br />
Premise was interesting. Writing was pretty good. Way too much macho underworld bro code kinda stuff. Stopped reading on the 9th page.

<blockquote>
I've worked for the Washington Post since 2008 as an editorial cartoonist. I have had editorial feedback and productive conversations—and some differences—about cartoons I have submitted for publication, but in all that time I’ve never had a cartoon killed because of who or what I chose to aim my pen at. Until now.
<br /><br />
The cartoon that was killed criticizes the billionaire tech and media chief executives who have been doing their best to curry favor with incoming President-elect Trump. There have been multiple articles recently about these men with lucrative government contracts and an interest in eliminating regulations making their way to Mar-a-lago. The group in the cartoon included Mark Zuckerberg/Facebook & Meta founder and CEO, Sam Altman/AI CEO, Patrick Soon-Shiong/LA Times publisher, the Walt Disney Company/ABC News, and Jeff Bezos/Washington Post owner.
