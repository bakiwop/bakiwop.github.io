<h2 class="name" align="center">The Spider</h2>		 
<br />

<p>
	once upon a weekend dreary, chores completed made me weary <br />
	the cause of which was sweeping and scrubbing, o'er each and every floor. <br />
	while i sat there nearly dreaming, suddenly i started screaming <br />
	as i began sorely screeching, screeching at my bedroom floor <br />
	"kill it, please," i sorely shouted, "kill it on my bedroom floor - <br />
	only this and nothing more." <br />
	<br />
	presently my eyes grew wider, cursed spider, can't abide her <br />
	"death," said i', "arachnid. truly your demise i do implore; <br />
	but the fact is i so hate you, and must hasten to erase you <br />
	from this earthly plane's existence, so you exist nevermore." <br />
	that the screams meant i did see you, crawling 'cross my bedroom floor - <br />
	merely this and nothing more. <br />
	<br />
	running to the closet screaming, all the while crazy seeming, <br />
	searching high and low for something, something for the bedroom floor. <br />
	"surely," yelled i, "surely there is something in this closet right here, <br />
	to eradicate this nightmare, and destroy the thing for sure. <br />
	let my heart be still a moment, to find the tool i need so sore - <br />
	solely this and nothing more. <br />
	<br />
	grab the broom and start a sweepin', surely wish i still was sleepin' <br />
	now i'm stuck awake and fighting this dread nightmare on my floor. <br />
	with fury sweeping into conscious, i consciously sweep the floor. <br />
	"get thee back into the tempest and the night's plutonian shore! <br />
	take thy eight accursed legs from off my sparkling bedroom floor - <br />
	only this and nothing more" <br />
	<br />
	and the spider ever cunning, starts across the floor a running <br />
	o'er unblemished tiles so squeaky, eight legs look sixteen, <br />
	runs its way into the closet, ran underneath the closet door. 'tis freaky. <br />
	"demon!" squeals i, "my poor attire, to wear again i'll ne'er aspire <br />
	because you done gone and run under, my cursed bedroom closet door - <br />
	those clothes to be worn nevermore."<br />
