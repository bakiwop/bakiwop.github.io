<p>bakiwop On The Issues</p>
<p>I am strongly in support of issues.</p>
<p>I promise universal healthcare coverage for every American citizen who is willing to pay for it themselves.</p>
<p>Education: <em>No Child Left Behind</em> is not enough! I introduce <em>All Children Pushed Forward</em>.</p>
<p>Jobs good. No jobs bad.</p>
<p>I am absolutely pro-marriage, and to uphold this wonderful union am fully prepared to legalize prostitution for those times of stress when couples aren't happy but they still need to get some.</p>
<p>I am positively maybe definitely possibly for legalization of gay marriage.</p>
<p>I support the war on drugs, not because it is doing anything to stop drug use, but because it employs hundreds of thousands of American citizens and it would suck if they lost their jobs.</p>
<p>I fully support the Star Wars initiative, but only the original trilogy, Episodes I and II weren't all that great.</p>
<p>War with Iraq is not enough. We need to ramp up our war effort with the entire world in order to save our economy. It worked in WWI and WWII so I promise, as your president, to push WWIII through congress to kick-start the economy that our Democratic and Republican presidents have ruined with devastating deficits and enormous and egregious overspending.</p>
<p>The <em>Domo Aregato Mr. Roboto</em> plan. I promise to outsource every single American job I can. In doing this I will assign every American who cannot find a job because of outsourcing a Federal Unemployed Consumer Kickback Undersignment number which will allow them to receive the comparable US wages from the company that outsourced their position. This means someone else does the work and you get the money. Period.</p>
<p>I strongly support the privatization of Social Security. That way, when the private company screws up Enron-style, the Federal government can swoop  in on them, acquire all of their assets, and actually afford Social Security again.</p>
<p>I strongly support global warming. I am from the Midwest and it gets fricking cold here in the winters.</p>
<p>I am against crime, unless you aren't, in which case I am for crime.</p>
<p>I am against big government. I promise to raise taxes and spend billions of additional dollars a year expanding and improving your government to ensure a small government for all Americans.</p>

<p>About bakiwop</p>
<p>bakiwop is running on the Omniberalative OmniAmerican  ticket - the only political party for all Americans, liberal and conservative. He was born in the Midwest in 1956. As a boy, he quickly discovered a dislike for chores which eventually led to a dislike for jobs, which has led him to a career in politics.</p>
<p>bakiwop would have fought in all of the wars he could have, only he has flat feet and asthma so no military branch would take him. He did, however, serve in the Boy Scouts of America with distinction and honor for over 10 years earning multiple merit badges as both a Cub Scout and a Boy Scout, eventually receiving the Order of the Arrow and National Eagle Scout honors. He is most proud of his 1st place victory in the Cub Scout Soap Box Derby Race of 1968.</p>
<p>bakiwop does not remember too much that happened to him between the celebration of his Soap Box Derby Race win and 1986, but he finally decided to leave his parents house at the age of 30 and get into the import/export business - often flying single-engine airplanes from Tijuana, Mexico to Los Angeles, CA. After 4 years running bakiwop Air, he became fabulously wealthy and went on a giant bender.</p>
<p>After waking from his coma in 2001, bakiwop decided to only do "soft drugs". Since making this life-changing decision, his thinking has become more lucid and he hardly ever sees little yellow men dancing inside of his soda cans anymore.</p>
<p>As you can see, bakiwop is a man who has "been there and done that", just like you. bakiwop is a man of the people and for the people. Just vote for the guy all ready.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, bakiwop never went to college but he can still pronounce the words "nuclear", "malfeasance", and "entrepreneur".</p>

<p>My first official act as president will be setting up a senate panel to look into the not-so-new phenomenon of what I term Auto-induced Self-Serving Enigmatic Syndrome, or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040428074521/http://www.consortiumnews.com/archive/colin6.html">ASSES</a>, to see why so many politicians and political appointees suffer situational- and operational-specific memory loss when asked publicly about things they have done or said. The cause of ASSES may be something as simple as a bacterial infection or as difficult as Political Onset Alzheimer’s, but given the frequency and duration of ASSES in the Capitol Hill area, I believe we need to investigate this problem posthaste. </p>

Adding his 78 visits to Camp David and his five visits to Kennebunkport, Maine, Bush has spent all or part of 500 days in office at one of his three retreats, or more than 40 percent of his presidency."

Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry, pressed by college students Monday to chart the different course he would follow in Iraq, said he would keep the United States in control of the military operation. 
</blockquote>
<p>Pressed by college students? All he had to do was offer to throw a kegger right there in the lecture hall and there would have been no more "pressing" of the issues. Is Kerry the kind of guy that you want running our country - when he can't even duck the issues properly in a roomful of college students? </p>

<p>I've got my new election strategy - I'm going to massively fund the Bush, Kerry, and Nader campaigns, and when they all take votes away from each other I will stand victorious! </p>

<p>Two of our nation's biggest issues this election are the war in Iraq and the cost of Medicare/Medicaid. Some people wonder how we can afford hundreds of billions of dollars for the war in Iraq but not afford the proper equipment for our troops over there and not afford healthcare for our elderly over here. Others wonder why we have to foot the health bill for all these old people who won't die already.</p>
<p>To take care of both these major election-year issues simultaneously, I will send all the old people on Medicare/Medicaid over to Iraq without the proper equipment to fight the war on terror. As one of the biggest and most powerful voting blocks of individuals in America, card carrying members of the AARP will, of course, be exempt from this mandate</p>

<p>I strongly support the privatization of Social Security. That way, when the private company screws up Enron-style, the Federal government can swoop in on them, acquire all of their assets, and actually afford Social Security again. </p>

<p>I have now received enough in campaign donations to go live life on a secluded island with lots of frothy drinks in hand. So, before I go live the life of luxurious laziness, let me leave you with this thought come November:</p>
