<br /><br />




<h5>02 August 2004 :: Monday</h5>
Candidates for the presidency are always throwing fundraising dinners, charging $1000, $1500, and even $2500 and up per plate.  It reminds me of my college days (at least I think I went to college as I'm paying back some student loans, I can't really remember too much about those days, and if Ididn't go to college then the student loan folks have some 'splaining to do) when people throwing parties didn't do the illegal thing and charge for beer, but rather had the beer and charged $5 at the door for the little plastic glass instead.
<br /><br />
Given that it is the presidential candidate type thing to do, I will be throwing my own party...errr...fundraiser at my place, it is <em>not</em> BYOB, but rather people entering will be charged $1200 for a little plastic cup upon entering and are then free to tap as much beer as they can.
<br /><br />
Remember: vote often, vote bakiwop.


<br /><br />

<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/06/11/social.security.ap/index.html" target="_blank">Social Security forecast due Monday</a> - bakiwop predicts a 95% chance of thunderstorms, damaging winds and hail and 100% chance of social security not being there when you retire unless you elect me and follow my social security plan:
<br /><br />
I strongly support the privatization of Social Security. That way, when the private company screws up Enron-style, the Federal government can swoop in on them, acquire all of their assets, and actually afford Social Security again.


<br /><br />


<h5>06 June 2004 :: Sunday</h5>
Healthcare is a prime issue this election year. Kerry says he will reduce insurance premiums which leaves those without insurance SOL. Bush says he will increase healthcare coverage which leaves those who have to pay rising insurance premiums SOL.
<br /><br />
You see, the problem with health insurance is that <em>people actually use it</em>. When people use the health insurance they are paying for, insurance companies increase their premium. I propose to provide insurance for everybody but make it illegal to use it; thus, insurance premiums will stay very low and insurance companies will not have to increase premiums.
<br /><br />
Remember: vote often, vote bakiwop.


<br /><br />


<h5>04 June 2004 :: Friday</h5>
Damnit, ran out of campaign funds while in Fiji <em>way</em> sooner than I had anticipated. With the US dollar fairing so poorly overseas, I ended up paying 3x's as much as I should have for booze and ganja. That pisses me off. So, in order to get more people to give me more money so I can <strike>get more island sun and rum</strike> get elected and lead this country to a new financial Golden Age I have to start a controversy. I would like to introduce, to this 2004 presidential race, the SEX SCANDAL.
<br /><br />
Frankly my fellow Americans, I am saddened by the lack of sexual scandals in this election year. What is it, Bush/Cheney - that wonderful headliner name for an S&amp;M show - don't have the cajones? The big brass pair? The Coo-Coo-jamungas to abuse their power in the manner and example set forth by our forefathers? And what about Kerry? Is he too busy kissing up to the Heinz money to try anything? Are these the kind of P-whipped panty-wastes you want running your country? Between them they hold vasts amount of power, money, and influence and yet they can't get laid by someone other than their wife (and even the wife thing is just a maybe!).
<br /><br />
I pledge to you, my fellow Americans, to get as much booty as I can while running for, and once I am in, Office.

I have now received enough in campaign donations to go live life on a secluded island with lots of frothy drinks in hand. So, before I go live the life of luxurious laziness, let me leave you with this thought come November:

Or you can vote for bakiwop.

<br />
Gun owners looked perplexed by Cheney statement stating, "But <em>we're</em> the ones with the loaded guns."
<br /><br />
In other news: <a target="_blank" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3635105.stm">Gun lobby sets up news operation</a>. I was honored to be one of the first interviewees for the news program:
<br /><br />
<strong><em>NRA</em></strong>: So, bakiwop, why should the NRA choose to endorse you for the presidency?
<br />
<strong><em>bakiwop</em></strong>: I have long been a supporter of peoples' rights to bear arms in a concealed fashion - I'm also a big fan of vigilante justice. It's all a part of my way to save the American people billions of dollars in law enforcement funds at all government levels. When the people are armed heavily enough, criminals will think twice about committing a crime.
<br />
<strong><em>NRA</em></strong>: Excellent, so you'll repeal all the current gun laws restricting the use of assault weapons? You'll drop the waiting period and expensive background checks for handguns?
<br />
<strong><em>bakiwop</em></strong>: Indeed. Enforcing all those laws is extremely costly, by getting them off the books the US government will be able to save even more money. Also, those background checks are horribly intrusive - I'm surprised privacy activists haven't been more enthusiastic about trying to get rid of those laws. Not to mention the paper work that the waiting periods cost your local, neighborhood gun shop owner. And how much in sales do you think they lose when someone comes in all pissed off about some perceived slight and wants to buy the biggest, most powerful gun available? And then when they find out about the waiting period and have all that time to cool off and decide not to buy a gun after all? The gun shop owners are the real victims here.
<br />
<strong><em>NRA</em></strong>: Thank you for your time, bakiwop.
<br />
<strong><em>bakiwop</em></strong>: No no no. Thank you. Would you please put the gun down now? I don't want to turn my back on you until the gun has been put down.
<br />
<strong><em>NRA</em></strong>: Oh sure...sure...

<br /><br />





<h5>15 April 2004 :: Thursday</h5>
Two of our nation's biggest issues this election are the war in Iraq and the cost of Medicare/Medicaid. Some people wonder how we can afford hundreds of billions of dollars for the war in Iraq but not afford the proper equipment for our troops over there and not afford healthcare for our elderly over here. Others wonder why we have to foot the health bill for all these old people who won't die already.
<br /><br />
To take care of both these major election-year issues simultaneously, I will send all the old people on Medicare/Medicaid over to Iraq without the proper equipment to fight the war on terror. As one of the biggest and most powerful voting blocks of individuals in America, card carrying members of the AARP will, of course, be exempt from this mandate.

<br /><br />
Pressed by college students? All he had to do was offer to throw a kegger right there in the lecture hall and there would have been no more "pressing" of the issues. Is Kerry the kind of guy that you want running our country - when he can't even duck the issues properly in a roomful of college students?

(for the following link, you will most likely have to register to see the article, i apologize for this. however, in order to fight the system, use username: frigoffregistering@noway.com password: hahaha .  remember my fellow americans, fight the system, at least until i <em>become</em> the system. )

<a target="_blank" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A62524-2004Apr8.html">"This is Bush's 33rd visit to his ranch since becoming president. He has spent all or part of 233 days on his Texas ranch since taking office, according to a tally by CBS News. Adding his 78 visits to Camp David and his five visits to Kennebunkport, Maine, Bush has spent all or part of 500 days in office at one of his three retreats, or more than 40 percent of his presidency."</a>
<br /><br />
My fellow Americans, to prove to you - my faithful electorate - that I can surpass Bush in <em>all</em> areas, I promise, as your president, to spend at least <em>50%</em> of my presidency on vacation. But not only that! I promise to spend 15% of that 50% vacation time <em>in other countries</em>! There is no act too heinous, too disconcerting, too whoopee-whoopee-whoo-pow-pow that I wouldn't promise it to get elected.

<br /><br />


<h5>09 April 2004 :: Friday</h5>
My first official act as president will be setting up a senate panel to look into the not-so-new phenomenon of what I term <em>Auto-induced Self-Serving Enigmatic Syndrome</em>, or <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/04/08/911.commission/index.html/">A</a><a target="_blank" href="http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/02/11/1076388402238.html?from=storyrhs">S</a><a target="_blank" href="http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1997/09/26/fundraising.wrap/">S</a><a target="_blank" href="http://www.consortiumnews.com/archive/colin6.html">E</a><a target="_blank" href="http://www.moldea.com/reagan-gj.html">S</a>, to see why so many politicians and political appointees suffer situational- and operational-specific memory loss when asked publicly about things they have done or said. The cause of ASSES may be something as simple as a bacterial infection or as difficult as Political Onset Alzheimer’s, but given the frequency and duration of ASSES in the Capitol Hill area, I believe we need to investigate this problem posthaste.
