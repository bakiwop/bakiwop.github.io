Want to give me lots of money that I may or may not spend campaigning for the presidency?
<br /><br />
Want to trade presidential consideration for sexual favors?
<br /><br />
Want me to come lecture at your business/school/group for hundreds of thousands of dollars?
<br /><br />
You can do all of the above and more, and it all starts by <a href="mailto:electbakiwop@hotmail.com">contacting me</a>.
