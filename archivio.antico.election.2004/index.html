Bakiwop on the issues:

I am strongly in support of issues.

Prescription drugs: Cheap booze and soft drugs as an alternative to high prescription drug costs. You want freedom? Try self-medication.

War on terror: Wage a war on the war on terror. The war on terror hasn't been nearly fast enough, creating a war on that war would end that war much faster. 

Out-sourcing of jobs: The All Play/All Pay Plan. Out-source American jobs to other countries but make those countries pay the people who lost their jobs in America the salaries. You don't work but get the money. 

War in Iraq/Medicare/Social Security: Send our old people over to Iraq without equipment. No equipment means a cheap war and no old people means cheaper Medicare/Medicaid and a much smaller burden on our Social Security system.

Healthcare: Provide all Americans free healthcare but make it illegal to use.

Big Government: I am against big government. I promise to raise taxes and spend billions of additional dollars a year expanding and improving your government to ensure a small government for all Americans.

Education: No Child Left Behind is not enough! I introduce All Children Pushed Forward.

Jobs good. No jobs bad.

I am absolutely pro-marriage, and to uphold this wonderful union am fully prepared to legalize prostitution for those times of stress when couples aren't happy but they still need to get some.

I am positively maybe definitely possibly for legalization of gay marriage.

I support the war on drugs, not because it is doing anything to stop drug use, but because it employs hundreds of thousands of American citizens and it would suck if they lost their jobs.

I fully support the Star Wars initiative, but only the original trilogy, Episodes I and II weren't all that great.

War with Iraq is not enough. We need to ramp up our war effort with the entire world in order to save our economy. It worked in WWI and WWII so I promise, as your president, to push WWIII through congress to kick-start the economy that our Democratic and Republican presidents have ruined with devastating deficits and enormous and egregious overspending.

Social Security: I strongly support the privatization of Social Security. That way, when the private company screws up Enron-style, the Federal government can swoop in on them, acquire all of their assets, and actually afford Social Security again.

I strongly support global warming. I am from the Midwest and it gets fricking cold here in the winters.

I am against crime, unless you aren't, in which case I am for crime.





Gun Control: Read my interview with the NRA, that says it all:

NRA: So, bakiwop, why should the NRA choose to endorse you for the presidency? 
bakiwop: I have long been a supporter of peoples' rights to bear arms in a concealed fashion - I'm also a big fan of vigilante justice. It's all a part of my way to save the American people billions of dollars in law enforcement funds at all government levels. When the people are armed heavily enough, criminals will think twice about committing a crime. 
NRA: Excellent, so you'll repeal all the current gun laws restricting the use of assault weapons? You'll drop the waiting period and expensive background checks for handguns? 
bakiwop: Indeed. Enforcing all those laws is extremely costly, by getting them off the books the US government will be able to save even more money. Also, those background checks are horribly intrusive - I'm surprised privacy activists haven't been more enthusiastic about trying to get rid of those laws. Not to mention the paper work that the waiting periods cost your local, neighborhood gun shop owner. And how much in sales do you think they lose when someone comes in all pissed off about some perceived slight and wants to buy the biggest, most powerful gun available? And then when they find out about the waiting period and have all that time to cool off and decide not to buy a gun after all? The gun shop owners are the real victims here. 
NRA: Thank you for your time, bakiwop. 
bakiwop: No no no. Thank you. Would you please put the gun down now? I don't want to turn my back on you until the gun has been put down. 
NRA: Oh sure...sure...
