<h1 class="enorme">Cat</h1>

<p>Ever since I moved to the Pacific Northwest I've heard tell tales of Bigfoot: "Big as a house and twice as mean," say some. "Gentle giant," claim others. And the inevitable, "I done bore Bigfoot's twins!"</p>
<p>Well let me tell you folks, I've seen her feller and gosh darned if you mightn't mistake him for Bigfoot at first glance.</p>
<p>So anyways, I was working from home one afternoon, just sittin' on the couch and countin' the minutes 'til I could punch out, dontcha know, when what should I see out my window?</p>
