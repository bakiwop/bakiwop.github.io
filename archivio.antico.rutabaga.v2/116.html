<h4>President <span class="white">Bush</span>: The Cost Of The <span class="white">War</span> Against Terrorism <span class="white">May Be</span> Costly, But A Costlier Cost Of <span class="white">Cost</span> Costs Even More Costliness In Cost <span class="white">Considerations</span> If No War Fought Against Terrorism <span class="white">At</span> All </h4>

<p>This was going to be a great Rutabaga article, I thought the title was neat-o and I had all these spiffy plans for it. Really. I promise.</p>
<p>Not only was I going to use cost-related phrases like "cost/benefit analysis", "cost efficient", "cost cutting", "cost of living",  "the cost of freedom is eternal vigilance" (okay, so the actual phrase uses 'price', not 'cost'), and others, but I was going use whole cost-related sentences like "Cost doesn't come into it.", "I think the cost is more in not doing anything.", and "We are determined, no matter what the cost, to do everything we possibly can to stamp out terrorism."</p>
<p>It was all going to be very witty, intelligent, funny, and many other positive adjectives.</p>
<p>But in the middle of writing the article, the word "cost" lost all meaning to me. The word started sounding strange and exotic; it began sounding like the Latin word meaning "that period in a battle when you realize those damn barbarian hordes are overwhelming your supposedly superior Roman forces and damnit I also just stepped in horse poo".</p>
<p>So, what I want you to do is re-read the title and come up with your own super great wonderful exciting stupendous outstanding really amazing story because I have a headache and need to lie down for a while.</p>
