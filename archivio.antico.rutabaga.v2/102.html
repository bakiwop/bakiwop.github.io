<h4>Pat Roberson <span class="white">Prays</span> For "Retiring Justices," <span class="white">Instead</span> Of The Usual "More <span class="white">Money</span>"</h4>


<p>Religious-type guy Pat Robertson has launched a 21-day prayer offensive directed at the Supreme Court in the wake of its 6-3 June vote that decriminalized sodomy.  The prayer offensive targets three Supreme Court Justices in particular, asking God if it would be possible to put it in the minds of these three judges that the time has come to retire.</p>
<p>"What a putz," said Justice John Paul Stevens, one of the three justices Robertson would like to see God retire. "I was going to step down at the end of the year, but now I’m not going to retire…ever."</p>
<p>Robertson said in a letter on his CBN Web site that the June ruling "has opened the door to homosexual marriage, bigamy, legalized prostitution and even incest."  Adding that, "Until I think of a way to make money on these things, they should definitely not be legalized."</p>
<p>Furthermore, Robertson stated, "They (the justices) will all burn in the eternal fiery depths of hell and damnation unless they change their ways, in which case they will only have to wade in the shallow, slightly cooler, end of Hades."</p>
<p>When asked what he thought of what was happening, God the Almighty Creator of the Heavens and Earth, had this to say, "I don’t know what I am going to do about those justices, but I was definitely surprised that Pat Robertson stopped praying about money long enough to pray to have me bump someone off."</p>
