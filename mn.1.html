			<blockquote>
				<p>St. Paul’s Raspberry Island has been reinvented again and again.</p>
				<p>In the 1890s, it was a popular spot to take a dip in the Mississippi River in summer and home to curling rinks in winter.</p>
				<p>Later, it was the site of a U.S. Navy training base. Its historic boat club housed a series of nightclubs with colorful names: Tugboat Annie’s, Golden Garter, River Serpent.</p>
				<p>It became an outdoor concert venue, hosting bands like R.E.M. and Aerosmith before spending a sad stretch of years as a parking lot.</p>
				<p>Today, the tiny 2-acre island underneath the Wabasha Street Bridge is a park, planted with ornamental grasses and small oak trees.</p>
