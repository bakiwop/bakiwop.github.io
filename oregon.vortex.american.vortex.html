<h2 class="name" align="center"><strike><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_Vortex">Oregon Vortex</a></strike> American Vortex</h2>		 
<br />



				<p>The American Vortex is a country-wide attraction that opened to citizens in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_United_States_(1776–1789)">late 18th century</a>, located in the middle of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America">North American</a> hemisphere. It consists of a number of interesting effects, which are financial oligarchical illusions, but which the attraction's proprietors propose is the result of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy">democratic</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism">capitalist</a> society.</p>

				<p><u>Background</u></p>
				<p>Prior to any unification of the area, local legend had it that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States">Native Americans</a> lived there and referred to the site as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_Island_(Native_American_folklore)">Turtle Island</a>, while travelers passing through would often find themselves conquering and displacing native peoples.</p>
				<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifest_destiny">manifest destiny</a> was built in the area in the 19th century by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifest_destiny#Etymology">John L. Sullivan</a>, which claimed by right to, "overspread and to possess the whole of the continent which Providence has given us for the development of the great experiment of liberty and federated self-government entrusted to us." By the 20th century the American Revolutionary War, the war against Native Americans, the American Civil War, the Spanish-American War, WWI, WWII, and many other wars and conflicts convinced <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robber_baron_(industrialist)">robber barons</a> that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military–industrial_complex">military-industrial complex</a> was the way forward, and convinced other rich people to come to the US. They said they researched the financial phenomenon of the so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Dream">land of opportunity</a>.</p>
				<p>By the mid 1960s <a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/statistics/historical-highest-marginal-income-tax-rates">marginal tax rates started dropping</a> and the country was sold out fully to those with means. These "meansies" kept the attraction open through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_segregation">racial</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socioeconomic_status">socioeconomic</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_segregation">religious segregation</a> making it one of the most recent examples of <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=the+screwing+of+non-rich+white+non-christian+folk+in+america">Steamroll Americana</a>.</p>
				<p>Odd financial maneuvers create an illusion of average citizens seemingly doing better financially. Some researchers have proposed that a framework, created in 1981 and called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trickle-down_economics">Trickle Down Economics</a>, would stimulate the American economy via business investment in the short term and benefit society at large in the long term. Other researchers proposed this framework uses orientation framing which describes how the brain's financial processing uses social frames of reference. They noted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism_for_the_rich_and_capitalism_for_the_poor">similar illusions</a> including the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponzi_scheme">Ponzi scheme</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramid_scheme">pyramid scheme</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_bubble">economic bubbles</a>. </p>
				<p>American Vortex is also famous for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_liberties">freedom</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice,_Illinois">justice</a>, though the apparent racial, socioeconomic, and religious relativity of individuals varies, depending on where each person stands on these scales. The explanation of the strange phenomena is that they are caused by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crime">financial illusions</a> and <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/03/02/most-americans-point-to-circumstances-not-work-ethic-as-reasons-people-are-rich-or-poor/">distorted backgrounds</a> that induce a <a href="https://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/pull-yourself-up-by-your-bootstraps.html">forced perspective</a>, as with the phrase that <a href="https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/declaration-transcript">"all men are created equal."</a> The American site also exhibits phenomena similar to those perceived by citizens of other countries around the world.</p>
