<p>We've had a beach hazards statement put out by the National Weather Service for about two weeks now. "Beach Hazards" usually indicates <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneaker_wave">sneaker waves</a>.
<blockquote>
The unpredictability of sneaker waves and their tendency to arrive suddenly after lengthy periods of gentle, lapping waves makes it easy for them to surprise unwary or inexperienced beachgoers; because they are much larger than preceding waves, sneaker waves can catch inattentive swimmers, waders, and other people on beaches and ocean jetties and wash them into the sea. The force of a sneaker wave's surge and the large volume of water rushing far up a beach is enough to suddenly submerge people thigh- or waist-deep, knock them off their feet, and drag them into the ocean or trap them against rocks.
</blockquote>
<p>A tourist got caught out by one recently: <a href="https://www.newportnewstimes.com/news/tragic-surf-rescue-near-siletz-bay/article_6ba76641-7e3c-4f09-a73c-3904c6fcaecf.html">'Tragic' surf rescue near Siletz Bay</a>.</p>
<p>The ocean's been angry these days, my friend. </p>

<p>This is a bit on the extreme side of standard Fall and Winter ocean behavior. In these months the beaches get smaller as the ocean pulls away much of the sand it built up over the Spring and Summer months. How does it pull the sand away, you might ask? <a href="https://explorebeaches.msi.ucsb.edu/sandy-beach-life/sand-movement">Let's ask UC-Santa Barbara</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
High-energy winter storm waves pull sand offshore, creating more narrow, cobbled beaches. Lower, gentle summer waves carry sand onshore, widening beaches.
</blockquote>
<pThere we go.</p>
<p>In fact, the wave action has been so intense here that two weeks ago we had some big wave surfers out there doing their thing about 100 yards from shore. Never seen them that close before. The waves were so big and the sea was so gnarly that they had a wave runner towing people into the waves and out of the surf.</p>

<p>Portland visit today.</p>
<p>Hit two extinct volcanoes - <a href="https://www.portland.gov/parks/mt-tabor-park">Mt. Tabor</a> and <a href="https://www.portland.gov/parks/joseph-wood-hill-park">Joseph Wood Hill Park</a>. Mt. Tabor was glorious with Fall colors. Joseph Wood had great views of a bunch of different peaks and the Columbia River. Also had a nifty fort-type thing at the top.</p>
<p class="embiggen"><img src="media/joseph.wood.hill.park.jpg" alt="" title"" /></p>
<p>Next stop was <a href="https://www.portland.gov/parks/laurelhurst-park">Laurelhurst Park</a> which was bigger than we thought it'd be and also full of colorful foliage. Beautiful.</p>
<p>Stopped at <a href="https://steakadelphia.com/">Steakadelphia</a> for lunch. Ate outside at the picnic tables. Good food that just did not agree with our tummies. While The Better Half was using the facilities I witnessed a ... call it a traffic dispute. Young guy in a beat up mini-van and middle-aged guy in a hatchback. Didn't see what originally happened, but they both stopped, rolled down their windows, yelled at each other across five lanes of traffic, then exited their vehicles. Kid stomped across all five lanes without looking. <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Steakadelphia/@45.4974443,-122.6017549,3a,75y,284.26h,78.21t/data=!3m8!1e1!3m6!1sCg7SlF36VZKiy0WJV1-BkA!2e0!5s20211201T000000!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fcb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile%26w%3D900%26h%3D600%26pitch%3D11.788954185740977%26panoid%3DCg7SlF36VZKiy0WJV1-BkA%26yaw%3D284.25974918049934!7i16384!8i8192!4m14!1m7!3m6!1s0x5495a0683d232983:0x7db1afd46ff80d2a!2sSteakadelphia!8m2!3d45.4976686!4d-122.6020347!16s%2Fg%2F1thxvycz!3m5!1s0x5495a0683d232983:0x7db1afd46ff80d2a!8m2!3d45.4976686!4d-122.6020347!16s%2Fg%2F1thxvycz?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MTEwNC4xIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D">Dicey proposition</a>. They exchanged viewpoints with verve. Young guy kept wandering back and forth into traffic. Middle-aged guy kept goading him on. They finally had enough, returned to their vehicles, and drove off.</p>
<p>Traffic behaved very well, thank goodness, so no one was smooshed.</p>
<p>The Better Half came back outside and asked me what was going on. Said the people inside were all staring out the big picture window (which was directly behind me). Poor thing thought something had happened to me.</p>
<p>Not me, your honor, no troublemaker I.</p>
<p>Just finished with the <a href="https://www.statesmanjournal.com/story/news/2025/11/02/king-tides-returning-to-oregon-coast-november-5-7/86995134007/">first of the king tides of the season</a>, throw in a weather prediction of no rain on Saturday, and tourists abound. Though, to be fair, tourists almost always abound (save for about two weeks after Labor Day and a week or so after New Year's). Saturday looks like it will be a good day for a ride, but fear I might yet be suffering the ill effects of the steak sandwich of doom.</p>
<p>Dooooooooom, I tells ya! Dooooooooooooom!</p>
