			This was originally going to be a <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/pepys_samuel.shtml">Samuel Pepys</a> <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4200">diary</a> kind of thing so I wasn't going to do tags or comments and I was going to have the entries display in chronological order instead of reverse chronological order but then I realized I would never be a member of parliament and historians from hundreds and thousands of years in the future would have television shows like <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0285351/">According to Jim</a> and <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083395">Cagney and Lacey</a> as a much more accurate historical record for what life was like during my lifetime than anything I could come up with so I started thinking about what to do with this - if anything - and then I thought, <em>well, whatever I gosh darn want</em>, so here I am making an unplanned mess of things, as usual, marking it up by hand and keeping it in chronological order and only kinda sorta using tags and maybe possibly considering putting in <a href="https://cactus.chat/">Cactus Comments</a> but probably not and you should most likely just turn around right now and <a href="https://linktr.ee/nuzzlehouse">go visit a far more worthwhile website</a>.
