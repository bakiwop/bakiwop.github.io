<p>Beach Hazards Statement</p>
<blockquote>
* WHAT...Sneaker waves possible.
<br /><br />
* WHERE...North and Central Coast of Oregon, and South
  Washington Coast.
<br /><br />
* WHEN...Through late Sunday night.
<br /><br />
* IMPACTS...Waves can run up significantly farther on a beach than
  normal, including over rocks and jetties. Sneaker waves can
  suddenly knock people off of their feet and quickly pull them
  into the frigid ocean which may lead to serious injury or
  drowning.

One of our state’s go-to spring break destinations, Cannon Beach, was recently named one of the safest spring break destinations in the U.S. in a new trending study that identified several threats to travelers.

<p>Back home we say we're going to the lake. That's because it's 90 degrees out and we're eventually gonna hop in the lake to cool off and have some fun. Out here they say they're going to the beach. Because the ocean in Oregon will kill you - riptides, sneaker waves, diamond hard volcanic rock, and an entire ocean of things that will eat you. Alive or dead. And the water is about 45 degrees so nobody goes into the water anyway. And the air temperature is about 55 degrees... if you're lucky... and the 20 mph wind is blowing sand all over the place. I'm not sure why people go to the beach on spring break around here. I mean, people set up tents on the beach to get out of the wind and the stinging sand and the cold. I once saw a couple of teenagers wearing swimsuits - this was about eight years ago - and I couldn't believe there were people brave enough to try that.</p.
