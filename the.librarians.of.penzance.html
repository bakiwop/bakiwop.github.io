<h1 class="enorme">The Librarians of Penzance</h1>


		 

<p>
I am the very model of a modern-day librarian<br />
Give info most authoritative, wholly nonsectarian<br />
Look up the kings of England, and can find the fights historical<br />
From Marathon to Waterloo, in order categorical<br />
Make you well acquainted, too, with all matters mathematical<br />
You'll understand equations, both the simple and quadratical<br />
About binomial theorem you'll be teeming with lots o' news<br />
I'll find you cheerful facts about the square of the hypotenuse<br />
<br />
I'm very good at finding information that's analogous<br />
To needs most differentiated, important, and fatuous<br />
In short, authoritative information nonsectarian<br />
I am the very model of a modern-day librarian.<br />
<br />
Can find the information that you seek, I'm Johnny-on-the-spot<br />
Answer inquiries from everyone, I will surely give a shot<br />
Need to know elegiacs or all crimes of Heliogabalus?<br />
'Bout conics I'll find you peculiarities parabolous<br />
Give you info about artistic works and all the symphonies<br />
And 'bout the croaking chorus from The Frogs of Aristophanes!<br />
Find you a title for the song you hum and heard but once afore<br />
And lyrics to the song from that infernal nonsense Pinafore<br />
<br />
Show you a written washing bill in Babylonic cuneiform<br />
Then find you ev'ry detail of Caractacus's uniform<br />
In short, authoritative information nonsectarian<br />
I am the very model of a modern-day librarian<br />
<br />
Find you materials about the "mamelon" and "ravelin"<br />
and then make sure that you can find them without help from me again<br />
And those inquiries and questions you're feeling most embarrassed of<br />
Know that at you I will not giggle, disparage or make fun of<br />
I'll teach you how to search all things so you can do it by yourself<br />
And make sure you can find it on internet and library shelf<br />
I'll show elemental information finding strategy<br />
And then you'll never ever again have to friggin' bother me<br />
<br />
For your information knowledge, though I'm plucky and adventury<br />
Give know-how that you will need for all things self-exploratory<br />
In short, authoritative information nonsectarian<br />
I am the very model of a modern-day librarian.<br />
