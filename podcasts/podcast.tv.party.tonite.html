<h2><a href="podcast.tv.party.tonite.html#2012.01.27a">Notes on TV Party Tonite 01×01 – Two Dollars on Trouble to Win</a></h2>
<span class="navdivide">January 27, 2012</span>
<p>I’m pretty sure the “short-lived show” we were trying to recall, that Timothy Olyphant was on before <cite>Deadwood</cite>, was his brief guest appearance on <cite>The Office</cite> as Danny Cordray, the slick salesman who became Jim’s nemesis for a couple of episodes before abruptly disappearing (to star in <cite>Justified</cite>?).</p>
<p>Olyphant, of course, was terrific on <cite>Deadwood</cite> as sheriff turned hardware merchant Seth “Mister Furious” Bullock. Even though the character didn’t require a particularly broad emotional range (Barely Suppressed Simmering Rage -> Actual Expressed Rage), he did have to come across as genuinely dangerous, while also conveying enough charm to make Bullock sympathetic. Unfortunately, when Olyphant isn’t playing a guy teetering on the edge of extreme violence, he runs into problems. Seth Bullock was a good role for him because he was never, as far as I can recall, called upon to grin. (Another actor who should probably avoid grinning? Willem Dafoe.)</p>
<p class="abbeynormal"><img class="space-yo" src="images/podcast.tv.party.tonite.olyphant.jpg" /></p>
<p>Olyphant has one of the creepiest grins I’ve ever seen. His face looks best when it’s rigid and unsmiling; when he grins, some unpleasant alchemy happens with his eyebrows and hooded eyes that makes him look like a man under the effect of some hallucinogenic who’s just remembered a really funny joke as he’s about to approach an attractive woman. On <cite>Justified</cite>, though, he seems to be moderating his expressions of levity so that his face stops just short of creepiness.</p>
