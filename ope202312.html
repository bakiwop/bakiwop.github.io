<p>Today is Great White's ten year anniversary with us. We call her Great White because she's great, she's white, and <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=great+white+sharks+circling&t=ffab&iax=videos&ia=videos">she will circle you over and over again</a> for reasons known only to her.</p>
<p>Great White is a cat. <a href="https://archive.org/details/snoring.3gp">Here's a little vid of her snoring.</a></p>
<p>She's actually 18 1/2 now. This means, of course, that we got her secondhand. That's another nickname for her: Secondhand Cat. Other nicknames include Sweet Pea, Sweetie, Honey Baked, Little One, Fluffy Battle Kitten (stolen from an <a href="https://fluffybattlekitten.com/">old school blogger</a>), Darling, Darling One, Beautiful, Gatta Bianca and Bella Ragazza. Her actual name is Snowflake, which was her name before we met her.</p>
<p>Being 18 1/2, she has many health problems. Two weeks ago we thought we were going to lose her, but our girl is a fighter...always has been. She's tenacious, another nickname for her is Tenacious C. She died once on an operating table about six years ago, turns out she was allergic to the anesthesia they gave her. They came out, told us, then asked us if we wanted them to try and resuscitate her. Our answer was, "Yes, please."</p>
<p>As I said, she has a lot of health issues. She has two vets, one in town where we live and the other at the teaching hospital at the big state university. She's going to see an orthopedist, a cardiologist, an oncologist, and an internal medicine vet. Poor Little One, that's a lot of vet visits. She is not fond of vets. She indicates her lack of fondness through hissing and swiping.</p>
<p>In the ten years she's been a part of the family, she's lived in three different states. She is not fond of travel. The move to the second state was 2000 miles. Poor thing! The move to the third state was only about 300 miles. When I say "part of the family," I do not mean we think of her as our child. She is not our daughter. We are not her mom and dad. She is, however, part of the family.</p>
<p>She's an amazing, wonderful, groovy little thing.</p>

<p>It is my wife's and my 28th anniversary. We've been together 28 years. 28. I keep repeating it because it can't be true.</p>
<p>Our first date was on December 30th, 1995. A year that seems an impossibly long time ago now. We went to see <em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113497/">Jumanji</a></em>. We were going to go to <a href="https://tgifridays.com/">TGI Fridays</a> after but it was too busy so we just went back to my apartment and watched <em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093565/">Moonstruck</a></em>. That's right, we knew how to party back then.</p>
<p>We met at work, a plasma collection facility on University Avenue in St. Paul. She worked up front prepping donors and I worked in back sticking 'em with needles and hooking them up to the plasma collection machines. We worked second shift. When we got off work we'd hang out at the Barnes and Noble in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Har_Mar_Mall">Har Mar Mall</a> til they closed then we'd go walk around Como or Lake of the Isles or Bde Maka Ska. After a couple of months she moved in with me and bing bang boom here we are 28 years later.</p>
<p>Stacy has made me a better person, taught me what love is, and been extremely kind and patient with me over the years. She believes I've done the same for her.</p>
<p>She's an amazing, wonderful, groovy little thing.</p>
<p>I seem to be surrounded by amazing, wonderful, groovy little things.</p>

<p>The holidays are extra holiday-y for our little family. We have the usual Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year, but then we add Tenacious C's anniversary (December 29th), my wife's and my anniversary (December 30th), my parent's wedding anniversary (December 26th), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Nicholas_Day">St. Nick's Day</a> (December 6th), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Befana">La Befana</a> (January 5th), <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/culture/article/epiphany-three-kings-day-why-how-we-celebrate">Epiphany</a> (end of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve_Days_of_Christmas">twelve days of Christmas</a>) (January 6th), and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230927161125/https://driftwoodlib.org/wintersolstice.php">Solstice</a> (longest night of the year).</p>
<p>Phew.</p>
<p>I think, technically, you could throw New Year's Eve, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advent_calendar">Advent</a>, and Christmas Eve into the mix as well. I especially love Christmas Eve, makes me think of dark nights softly lit by Christmas trees while snow gently falls outside (<a href="https://archive.org/details/christmas.night.rain.2023">though, not so much since we've moved out here</a>). Advent might be cheating a bit, but any time I can open a little door and get a chocolate treat for a couple of weeks is a good holiday in my books. New Year's Eve? Good-natured drunken revelry with lots of laughter, shouting and/or banging of pots and pans.</p>
<p>I hope your holiday season has been a good one so far. Happy New Year's Eve.</p>
