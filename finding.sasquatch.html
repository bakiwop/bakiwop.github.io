	</div>


<p>Ever since I moved to the Pacific Northwest I've heard tell tales of Bigfoot: "Big as a house and twice as mean," say some. "Gentle giant," claim others. And the inevitable, "I done bore Bigfoot's twins!"</p>
<p>Well let me tell you folks, I've seen her feller and gosh darned if you mightn't mistake him for Bigfoot at first glance.</p>
<p>So anyways, I was working from home one afternoon, just sittin' on the couch and countin' the minutes 'til I could punch out, dontcha know, when what should I see out my window? Sasquatch urinating on my lawn.</p>

</p>
<p>"Well slap my tush and call me Martha," I says to myself.</p>
<p>By the by, I knew it weren't the missus fiddlin' in the yard cuz she was sittin' right beside me. The missus just so happened to also be countin' the minutes 'til I could punch out, too, so's I could start makin' The Meatloaf.</p>
<p>Now now, hold 'er right there, folks, that's not a euphemism, I make the best meat loaf in the county. Heck, I won first prize at the county fair three years runnin' and let me tell ya, it woulda been four 'cept that darn Elmer Ostlburg done gone bribed the judge with a coupon book of free movie passes.</p>
<p>Speakin' of the missus, I looked over at her real quick-like to see if she seen what I saw, but she was engrossed in one of her talkin' books - somethin' 'bout some murder mystery or other, I s'pose. She loves her some Agatha Christie.</p> 
<p>So I break out the phone, shot the video above and bolted to the door so's I could take a looksee, but when I got outside there was nuthin there 'cept a rather pungent odor of mossy earthy smell. I've darn near busted my brains tryin' to come up with a better description, but it's the only way I know to describe it.</p>
<p>Besides, every time I try to think back too hard on that smell, my eyes start waterin' somethin' fierce.</p>
<p>I still woulda left it at a prank by someone, maybe even that connvin' Elmer Ostlburg tryin' to pay me back for making him eat his lunch three years runnin', but when I went to go water the yard this mornin' the grass grown thirteen inches. Thirteen! I even went and got the missus' fancy tailor sewin' tape measure and everything just to make sure - and didn't she kick up a fuss about that - and sure enough: thirteen inches.</p>
<p>The missus is a might perplexed by it all and thinks I'm pullin' her leg, and that's fair enough, but I know the truth: Bigfoot peed in my yard and made the grass grow. Bigfoot is real, and I'm gonna find it.</p>
