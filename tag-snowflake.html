She's actually 18 1/2 now. This means, of course, that we got her secondhand. That's another nickname for her: Secondhand Cat. Other nicknames include Sweet Pea, Sweetie, Honey Baked, Little One, Fluffy Battle Kitten (stolen from an <a href="https://fluffybattlekitten.com/">old school blogger</a>), Darling, Darling One, Beautiful, Gatta Bianca and Bella Ragazza. Her actual name is Snowflake, which was her name before we met her.

Took Tenacious C to a cardiology appointment. Last minute cancellation yesterday afternoon for them meant we got the call to fill the spot and take her today. A month earlier than the earliest appointment we could get previously. Yay team.
