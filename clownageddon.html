<h1 class="enorme">Clownageddon</h1>

<p>11:43pm - the circus clowns tumbled out of their miniature car by the dozens & flopped, in their big-shoed way, toward the rodeo clown bar. time for a reckoning. </p>
<p>11:46pm - as the circus clowns burst through the bar's door they whistled Ennio Morricone's "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" theme on their kazoos. </p>
<p>11:47pm - the rodeo clowns dove into barrels for cover, slowly peeking over the edges, adjusting cowboy hats & brandishing colored hankies for the onslaught. </p>
<p>11:48pm - seeing the rodeo clowns' hankies, the circus clowns dropped their kazoos & grabbed their own hankies from ears, noses, & mouths. it was on. </p>
<p>11:50pm - the rodeo clowns emerged from their barrels - with their sneakers they were confident they could outmaneuver their floppy-shoed adversaries. <br /</p>
<p>11:51pm - a rodeo clown threw the 1st punch, the fist landing squishingly on a circus clown's red nose with an AOOGA! before bouncing off harmlessly. </p>
<p>11:53pm - another circus clown tried to make a balloon animal bull to scare the rodeo clowns with, but in haste, made a giraffe instead. big mistake. </p>
<p>11:54pm - a circus clown sprayed a bottle of seltzer wildly, hitting friend & foe alike; a panicked circus clown is nobody's ally (save laughter's). </p>
<p>11:58pm - while fighting, a rodeo clown deftly repainted a circus clown's happy face to a sad one making the circus clown slump on a bar stool & sulk. </p>
<p>12:01am - a circus clown hopped onto the bar's mechanical bull - the rodeo clowns couldn't help but watch. the circus clowns crept up behind them. </p>
<p>12:02am - a circus clown dropped & stepped on its whoopee cushion, the noise breaking the spell of the mechanical bull riding circus clown for the rodeo clowns. </p>
<p>12:03am - as the rodeo clowns raised their hankies to attack, the circus clown riding the mechanical bull fell off & landed on a squirting flower. </p>
<p>12:04am - the rodeo clowns leapt into action trying to distract the mechanical bull & save the fallen circus clown. rodeo clowns are brave, not smart. </p>
<p>12:05am - the circus clowns hesitated - rodeo clowns were their sworn, whiteface enemies & yet they were trying to help a fellow clown out. clown quandary. </p>
<p>12:08am - so the circus clowns & the rodeo clowns made peace, but as they left the bar they saw the children's party clowns lurking in the shadows. </p>
