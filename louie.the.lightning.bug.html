<h1 class="enorme">Louie the Lightning Bug</h1>


		 

<p>Louie the Lightning Bug was getting ready for a night on the town, but he was sad. It was two weeks into mating season and he hadnâ€™t even had a date, much less bumped lights with a lady.</p>
<p>As Louie left his home for an evening of courtin', he made a pledge to himself. "I, Louie, hereby pledge," he began, "to light it up with the ladies tonight!" And he flew out to the field d'amor with a determined look on his face.</p>
<p>Louie took a moment to look around, kinda scopin' out the scene. <em>Yeah, baby!</em> Louie thought to himself. <em>I can do this!</em></p>
<p>He started singing <em>Light My Fire</em>.</p>
<p>
<em>Come on baby light my fire!</em><br />
<em>Come on baby light my fire!</em><br />
<em>Try to set the night on fire!</em>
</p>
<p>Man, he loved that last line. Someday Louie hoped to set the night on fire with his butt light.</p>
<p>"Hey lady! Hey lady!" he said to a nearby lady lightning bug. "Look at my shining butt!"</p>
<p>He flashed his light on and off a few times, but the lady lightning bug didn't seem interested.</p>
<p>*Wiggle* *wiggle* *wiggle* went Louie's patootie. "Look at my butt! Look at my butt!"</p>
<p>"I've seen brighter light from a burnt out bulb," said the lady lightning bug as she flew away, a look of disdain crossing her little lightning bug face.</p>
<p>Louie was sad for a moment but then regrouped. "I <em>will</em> get a lady tonight!" he said to himself as he flew toward a group of three lady lightning bugs.</p>
<p>"All right ladies," he said to the group. "Line up! Line up! My name's Louie. Prepare to be dazzled by the butt light!"</p>
<p>The lady lightning bugs looked at each other and laughed a little laugh, but they had been drinking a lot of lightning bug liquor and decided to give Louie a try.</p>
<p>Lady Lightning Bug Number One had been drinking a bit more than her friends, and she was so excited by what she thought would be a wonderful light display of lightning love, that she shoved a little lightning bug dollar in Louie's pants.</p>
<p>"Go ahead," said Lady Lightning Bug Number One. "Show me the light!"</p>
<p>Louie swung his little lightning bug bottom toward her, concentrated hard on getting the right amount of chemicals in his behind, and then let out a little burst of light.</p>
<p>*Blink*</p>
<p>"Hee hee hee! Hah hah hah!" laughed Lady Lightning Bug Number One (for that is actually how lightning bugs laugh).</p>
<p>She grabbed her dollar back and sped off into the twilight, looking for the true lightning bug love of her life.</p>
<p>"I can do better! I can do better!" Louie cried to the other two lady lightning bugs. "Hold on a sec! Just wait!"</p>
<p>"Okay," said Lady Lightning Bug Number Two. "I may regret this, but I am going to give you a shot."</p>
<p>Louie concentrated even harder than the last time. He poured mucho chemicals into his little lightning bug behind and then...</p>
<p>*Blink* *Blink*</p>
<p>"Hmmph!" said Lady Lightning Bug Number Two. "Pretty pathetic. It was a little brighter than the last one, but nothing to write home about. I'm not leaving the light on over my door for <em>you</em> tonight!"</p>
<p>Lady Lightning Bug Number Two turned her back toward Louie and flew off into the night.</p>
<p>"Oh man, I can't do this," said Louie to Lady Lightning Bug Number Three. "You might as well just leave now."</p>
<p>"Well, I was going to," said Lady Lightning Bug Number Three, "but you look so pathetic that I'm going to give you a chance. Just make sure to try and light that behind <em>really bright</em> this time!"</p>
<p>Then she gave him a little lightning bug  smile.</p>
<p>"Okay," said Louie, feeling strange lightning bug emotions that he had never felt before.</p>
<p><em>Gee</em>, he thought to himself, <em>no lady lightning bug has ever smiled at me before. I feel all warm and fuzzy inside. I better not let her down!</em></p>
<p>*Wiggle* wiggle* *wiggle* went his little lightning bug bottom.</p>
<p>*Splash* *splash* *splash* went his little lightning bug chemicals.</p>
<p>He concentrated harder than he had ever concentrated before. His little lightning bug face was all scrunched up with the effort.</p>
<p>*BLINK* went Louie's behind.</p>
<p>There was a big flame and then lots of smoke.</p>
<p>"Wow!" went Lady Lightning Bug Number Three. "That was amazing! Why don't we go over behind that bush and do a little lightning bug love."</p>
<p>But there was no response from the middle of the cloud of smoke that hung around where Louie was.</p>
<p>"Louie?" said Lady Lightning Bug Number Three. "Louie? Are you there?"</p>
<p>There was still no response.</p>
<p>As the smoke cleared, Lady Lightning Bug Number Three didn't see any sign of Louie. She buzzed all around the area where he had been.</p>
<p>She looked up. No Louie.</p>
<p>She Looked Left. No Louie.</p>
<p>She looked right. No Louie.</p>
<p>Then, she looked down. There was Louie, lying on the ground. He was all black and shriveled.</p>
<p>"Louie! Louie!" Are you all right?"</p>
<p>"Huh?" said Louie. "Who said that? Everything is so dark."</p>
<p>"Oh Louie!" said Lady Lightning Bug Number Three. "That was amazing!  Wonderful! That was the best lightning bug butt display I have ever seen!"</p>
<p>"Yeah?" said Louie in a little voice. A little smile crossed his little lightning bug lips. "Yeah? You really think so?" He started coughing.</p>
<p>"Yeah," she said.</p>
<p>"All right," Louie said. He pumped his little lightning bug arm in the air once, smiled, and then Louie the Lightning Bug was no more.</p>
