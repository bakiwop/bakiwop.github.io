		<p>Went to Idaho. 16 June 2025 through 19 June 2025. Monday -  Thursday.</p>
		<p>Boise is a groovy place. Love the vibe. Love the art. Visited 9 1/2 years ago to check it out when I had a job offer in Meridian. Liked it then, too. If I could get a book mines gig there now it'd be a nifty place to live for a while.</p>
		<p>Went to <a href="https://www.nps.gov/crmo/index.htm">Craters of the Moon</a>. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craters_of_the_Moon_National_Monument_and_Preserve">Wikipedia</a>)</p>
		<p>Rubbed elbows with the rich and famous in Ketchum, ID. <a href="https://comlib.org/">The library there is the bomb diggity.</a> Almost worked there back in the day	, too, <a href="https://archive.ph/KhEf5">but couldn't afford it</a>. (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/31/us/sun-valley-workforce-housing.html">NYT article</a>) Beautiful area. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Valley,_Idaho">Interesting story about how Sun Valley came to be.</a></p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>During the winter of 1935â€“36, Harriman enlisted the services of an Austrian Sportsman, Count Felix von Schaffgotsch, to travel across the Western U.S. to locate an ideal site for a winter resort. The Count toured Mount Rainier, Mount Hood, Yosemite, the San Bernardino Mountains, Zion, Rocky Mountain National Park, the Wasatch Range, Pocatello, Jackson Hole, and Grand Targhee areas.</p>
			<p>Late in his trip and on the verge of abandoning his search for an ideal location for a mountain resort development, he backtracked toward the Ketchum area in central Idaho. A U.P. employee in Boise had casually mentioned that the rail spur to Ketchum cost the company more money for snow removal than any other branch line and the Count went to explore.</p>
			<p>Schaffgotsch was impressed by the combination of Bald Mountain and its surrounding mountains, adequate snowfall, abundant sunshine, moderate elevation, and absence of wind, and selected it as the site. Harriman visited several weeks later and agreed.</p>
