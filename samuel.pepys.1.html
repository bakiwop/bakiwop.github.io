		<p>Went to Idaho. 16 June 2025 through 19 June 2025. Monday -  Thursday.</p>
		<p>Boise is a groovy place. Love the vibe. Love the art. Visited 9 1/2 years ago to check it out when I had a job offer in Meridian. Liked it then, too. If I could get a book mines gig there now it'd be a nifty place to live for a while.</p>
		<p>Went to <a href="https://www.nps.gov/crmo/index.htm">Craters of the Moon</a>. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craters_of_the_Moon_National_Monument_and_Preserve">Wikipedia</a>)</p>
		<p>Rubbed elbows with the rich and famous in Ketchum, ID. <a href="https://comlib.org/">The library there is the bomb diggity.</a> Almost worked there back in the day	, too, <a href="https://archive.ph/KhEf5">but couldn't afford it</a>. (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/31/us/sun-valley-workforce-housing.html">NYT article</a>) Beautiful area. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Valley,_Idaho">Interesting story about how Sun Valley came to be.</a></p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>During the winter of 1935â€“36, Harriman enlisted the services of an Austrian Sportsman, Count Felix von Schaffgotsch, to travel across the Western U.S. to locate an ideal site for a winter resort. The Count toured Mount Rainier, Mount Hood, Yosemite, the San Bernardino Mountains, Zion, Rocky Mountain National Park, the Wasatch Range, Pocatello, Jackson Hole, and Grand Targhee areas.</p>
			<p>Late in his trip and on the verge of abandoning his search for an ideal location for a mountain resort development, he backtracked toward the Ketchum area in central Idaho. A U.P. employee in Boise had casually mentioned that the rail spur to Ketchum cost the company more money for snow removal than any other branch line and the Count went to explore.</p>
			<p>Schaffgotsch was impressed by the combination of Bald Mountain and its surrounding mountains, adequate snowfall, abundant sunshine, moderate elevation, and absence of wind, and selected it as the site. Harriman visited several weeks later and agreed.</p>

		<p>The PNW is a pretty funky place to live. The Oregon Coast doubly so.</p>
		<p>There's the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_Coast_Range">Oregon Coast Range</a> which butts right up against the Pacific Ocean. It frequently hails. It frequently rains when it's sunny. This leads to oodles of rainbows. Moss and molds abound. Deciduous trees are never bare and brown. If there aren't leaves on them there's moss. Lots of moss.</p>
		<p>Fungi also abound. Mushrooms grow everywhere.<p>
		<p>The temperature generally stays between forty and seventy degrees fahrenheit. It rarely snows. When it does it doesn't stick around long. It's a wet cold. This makes it feel much colder than it is. We're used to the dry colds back home. The moisture means hair is flat.</p>
		<p>There's a lot of salt in the air. Every couple of months we need to wash the house down to get the salt (and keep the moss) off. If cars are left outside surface rust happens very quickly. Keeping them in a garage seems to ameliorate this issue.</p>
		<p>There doesn't seem to be a level place in the joint. Hills up the wazoo. It's a good thing it rarely gets cold enough for water to freeze because with all the water we get around here and all the hills we have, driving or biking or walking would be difficult.</p>
		<p>It really does rain a lot. Heavy rains abound. Winds blow and gust hard, well into the double digits. When the winds blow and the rain thunders down...it's some nice moody weather. There are all kinds of lights rains, too. There is little lightning and thunder.</p>
		<p>All this is mostly true for the first 1/4 to 1/2 mile of land from the ocean. While much of it rings true for the rest of the Coastal Range as well, there are differences. For instance, it can get much warmer there in the summer and much snowier in the winter.</p>

		<p>Not the best idea to just go for a drive over the 4th of July weekend. <a href="serial.1.html#13">This is why.</a> But a bit before ten pm on the fifth we decided to go for a little drive. Hit a couple beach accesses but there were so many bonfires (neither of us enjoy bonfire smoke) so we started driving around Devil's Lake. It was a little after ten by this point and we saw our first firework of the evening. We'd forgotten that the Devil's Lake Association puts on a fireworks display on the fifth. We found a place to pull over and watch the fireworks. Was nifty.</p>

		<p><a href="serial.10.html#93">Bought a motorcycle 11 June</a>.

			<li>Helped former IT guy who suffered a stroke get <a href="https://www.overdrive.com/apps/libby">Libby</a> working. He and wife were very grateful. Wife took me aside later and told me husband was so relieved I didn't make him feel "stupid and incompetent."</li>
			<li>Patron told me they didn't have any friends and I was the only one they could joke around and smile with.</li>
			<li>Patron came in very frustrated and angry about having to make copies. Didn't know how to do it. I showed them how. After copies were made they were even angrier and more frustrated I didn't do it for them.</li>
			<li>Patron let me know people were controlling the weather. When I asked how that was possible they suggested I look it up online to learn all about it.</li>
			<li>Found proselytizing post-it in the stacks. "Jeremiah 31:3: I have always loved you and I always will love you."</li>
			<li>Patron hug after helping them fix their iPhone.</li>

		<p>Notable patron interactions from the previous week:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>A patron who read Dostoevsky's <cite><a href="https://search.worldcat.org/title/52578655">The Idiot</a></cite> as a 10-year-old (they liked the title) is now, at 85, reading it again to see what they think of it seven-and-a-half decades later. Wonder if it will hold up.</li>
			<li>Told a patron that they didn't have to go home but they couldn't stay here when we were about a minute from closing. They couldn't decide between three Tom Clancy novels. I told them they should take all three and if there were any they didn't like they'd get their money back. Library humor.</li>
			<li>Got cussed out in two languages by a long-time regular. They started by calling me fucking lazy because I sit at the reference desk all day. I tried explaining that, as a reference librarian, sitting at the reference desk is the majority of my job. They didn't much care for that line of reasoning and went on to explain their position vociferously and multilingually. Let them know they can think whatever they like, but cussing out staff is inappropriate behavior and if they continued they'd have to leave for the day. They continued then left for the day.</li>

		<p>Interview with the public library in Flagstaff, AZ. Another cool place. Just like last week, still not sure about pay cut (only ~$25k/yr this time around) and what effect it would have on pension and potential retirement. The conundrum: do we settle for the pretty nifty life we have here and travel lots or possibly hurt our chances of retirement but move around every few years.</p>

		<p>Sunday 10 August 2025</p>
		<p>Miles riding: 372. Especially nice ride <a href="serial.14.html#118">yesterday</a>.</p>
		<p>Hours writing: 0. Drat. Though I did find an old piece I'd been looking for for years: <a href="twas.the.night.before.christmas.html">'Twas the Night Before Christmas</a>. It's a little on the mean side of things but I really enjoy it. Glad I finally found it.</p>
		<p>Notable patron interactions:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Patron request: combustion libraries. Patron wanted in-state libraries with non-digital primary sources going back a few hundred years. Found options at the <a href="https://www.cookchemlab.com/">University of Oregon</a> and <a href="https://research.engr.oregonstate.edu/blunckgroup/combustion-ignition-radiation-and-energy-laboratory">Oregon State University</a>.</li>
			<li>Middle-school aged patron looking for some specific books went from being so shy around me they could barely speak to joking around with me and calling me Matthew.</li>
			<li>Got another hug. I'm averaging one per week lately.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>During online searches I've been using <a href="https://bing.com">Bing</a> more than <a href="https://google.com">Google</a> lately. The results are better and Google has taken to ignoring basic search parameters (-, "", etc). This has been happening more and more lately.
		<p>More work on <a href="archivio.antico.html">archivio.antico</a>: <a href="archivio.antico.herbie.2001/index.html">Herbie</a>, <a href="archivio.antico.election.2004/index.html">Election 2004</a>, and <a href="archivio.antico.rutabaga.v2.2002/index.html">Rutabaga v2</a>.</p>
		<p>Decided against moving for now. No Boise and no Flagstaff for us. We have a pretty good life and trying to make it even better by moving to a new place is too much of a gamble. Big risk for minimal gains. We'll continue taking day and weekend trips. We might still move back to the Twin Cities, though, should I ever get a job offer there.</p>
		<p>Decided against embedding offsite media (think youtube vids and the like). Much better privacy-wise. Went through and changed all old embeds with links. Still occasionally embed local media.</p>
		<p>Father memory: Letting me steer the car (from the passenger seat (when I was in grade school)) after swim practice at the high school.</p>
		<p>Snowflake memory: using my suitcase as a bed so often I had to get a second suitcase.</p>

		<p>Miles riding: 718. Tried doing some off pavement riding (forest roads and the like) but couldn't because of fire hazards from drought conditions up in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_Coast_Range">Coastal Range</a>.

		<p>We had the first sneaker wave warning of the season over the weekend. Seas were rough and beaches were dangerous. We had some big wave surfers out there doing their thing about 100 yards from shore. Never seen them that close before. The waves were so big and the sea was so gnarly that they had a wave runner towing people into the waves and out of the surf.</p>

		<p>Went to <a href="https://tormentedillusion.com/">a haunted house</a> on Friday with a couple friends. Haven't been to one in a couple decades. It was fun! They did a great job putting it on. Last time I went to a haunted house I was in my early 20s. Stacy had to work and the couple I went with got in a fight and left, so I tagged along with this young mother and her kids. When we finished she asked if I had been scared. I said no. Then she asked why I had been holding onto her jacket so much. Busted!</p>
