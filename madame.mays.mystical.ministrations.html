<p>I was walking around the annual Octoberfest festival when I stumbled over a tent peg and landed, butt first, in a pile of crisp, colorful leaves.  There was a bit of good-natured snickering from the families that turned my way to see what all the commotion was about - adorable kids wearing cute knit caps peered at me around grand swaths of cotton candy, bored teenagers looked up briefly from their cell phones to take a picture of me before returning to their perennial state of disassociation and parents smiled and headed my way to help me up.<br /><br />After getting up, giving my thanks to my rescuers and brushing the red and yellow leaves from my coat and pants a voice said, "I knew that was going to happen."<br /><br />I turned and saw a pudgy, middle-aged lady wearing a robe with stars and moons on it.  She had wonderfully elaborate rings on her fingers and was wearing an amulet with a long knife blade at the end of it around her neck.<br /><br />"And you couldn't have told me ahead of time?"<br /><br />She tapped a sign that stood outside her tent - the tent with the tent peg I tripped over - with intricately detailed calligraphy, the sign read: "Madame May's Mystical Ministrations - Futures Predicted, Dead Talked To".<br /><br />I gave her a look of incomprehension.  She sighed, rolled her eyes, and pointed at the bottom line.<br /><br />$20.<br /><br />Oh.<br /><br />"Yes," I protested, "but I didn't know you knew something would happen, right?  I mean, isn't that more your field?  Besides, it's already happened, why would I want to give you $20 now?"<br /><br />She gave me a look while continuing to point to the part of her sign that read $20 and said, "Do you think it's maybe possible that there might be something else you may need to know?"  She wiggled her eyebrows and nodded her head.  I reached into my wallet, handed her a twenty, and followed her inside.<br /><br />The tent was everything you'd expect - dark and musty, smell of burnt incense, skulls and strange symbols decorating the walls, and, of course, the requisite small table with big glass ball book-ended by two chairs.<br /><br />She sat down, pointed to the opposite chair and started right in.<br /><br />"I'm seeing someone...someone very dear to you...things are a bit fuzzy..."<br /><br />"Oh, that must be my uncle Oris, he always had to shave twice a day."<br /><br />She gave me another look and continued.  "I think their name starts with an...M."<br /><br />I shook my head.<br /><br />"N."<br /><br />Another shake.<br /><br />"Things can be unclear sometimes...maybe it's an...R?"<br /><br />I got up to leave and she grabbed my wrist.  "I'm just joking.  Sit down...sit down."<br /><br />As I began to sit back down, she said, "You are going to trip over a tent pole."<br /><br />Half sitting and half standing, I gaped at her.<br /><br />"You are going to trip over a tent pole," she repeated.<br /><br />"Are you serious?" I asked, my voice rising.<br /><br />Calmly, she nodded her head.<br /><br />"But I already did that!"<br /><br />More head nodding.<br /><br />"And you just charged me $20 to tell me that?"<br /><br />Another nod.<br /><br />"And you're not going to give me the twenty back, are you?"<br /><br />A shake of the head.<br /><br />I stormed out of the tent, looked at the tent pole I tripped over, headed the other way, tripped over another tent pole and landed, butt first, in another pile of leaves.<br /><br />There was more good-natured laughter, more little kids with cotton candy, more teenagers taking cell phone pictures and more smiling parents offering to help me up.<br /><br />As I brushed the leaves off me again I saw Madame May standing outside the tent holding a $20 in one hand and pointing to a sign on this side of her doorway.  The sign read: "$20 To Predict Your Future, $40 To Tell You How To Change It".<br /><br />She tipped me a wink and went back inside.<br /><br />"Bitch," I murmured under my breath.<br /><br />"I think you mean witch, dear," was the reply from the tent.</p>
