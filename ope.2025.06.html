			<p>In September, Tara Dower became the fastest person ever to complete the Appalachian Trail. Her record - 40 days, 18 hours and 6 minutes - was 13 hours faster than the previous record holder, a man. That same year, 18-year-old Audrey Jimenez made history in Arizona as the first girl to win a Division 1 high school state wrestling title - competing against boys.</p>
			<p>Across a variety of sports, women are not just catching up after generations of exclusion from athletics - they’re setting the pace. In ultramarathons, women regularly outperform men, especially as distances stretch toward the extreme. Jasmin Paris, who in 2024 became one of only 20 people ever to finish the brutal 100-mile Barkley Marathons race in under 60 hours - while pumping breast milk.</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>On 4 August 2020, a major explosion occurred in Beirut, Lebanon, triggered by the ignition of 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate. The chemical, confiscated in 2014 from the cargo ship MV Rhosus and stored at the Port of Beirut without adequate safety measures for six years, detonated after a fire broke out in a nearby warehouse. The explosion resulted in at least 218 fatalities, 7,000 injuries, and approximately 300,000 displaced individuals, alongside property damage estimated at US$15 billion. The blast released energy comparable to 1.1 kilotons of TNT, ranking it among the most powerful non-nuclear explosions ever recorded and the largest single detonation of ammonium nitrate.</p>

			<p>Not to pick on this person, it’s a funny protest sign — but it seems like a lot of people are thinking like we’re in a “one weird trick” (impeachment) scenario and, once we get that done, we’ll magically return to some type of “normal” and we can all go home… but the concept of normality is doing some heavy lifting here.</p>
