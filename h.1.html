		<p>Sometimes a bee will hit our big window overlooking the backyard and I have to wonder...did a bee just prank another bee?</p>
		<p>Like, maybe Robbie the bumble bee was doing his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waggle_dance">waggle dance</a> but instead of telling the other bees to turn left at the deck he tells them to turn right? And maybe after a couple of bees fly off Robbie says to all the other bees, "No no no guys. Don't go yet. Ya gotta see this!" and all the bees watch as eager beaver Toby, the first one to fly off, natch, smacks into our window?</p>
		<p>Do bees snicker? I bet bees snicker.</p>
		<p>Or maybe Robbie can't waggle dance. Robbie's got no rhythm. So Robbie meant to tell all the bees the proper place to go but when they all took off, Toby (that eager beaver, again) led the way and ran smack dab into our window. All the other bees would just shake their antennae and say, "Yup, that's Robbie for ya, can't waggle for shit," before they swooped down to make sure Toby was okay?</p>

			<p>And just how many people would join Starfleet to get selfies that no one else could so they'd get more followers? "Here's me going warp 8." "Here's me in the Borg cube." "Here's me doing the 'get shot by a phaser set to stun' challenge." Would prank vids for Youtube get out of control? Would cadets decompress fellow cadets' space suits during space walks? "Sorry, Cadet Peters, I know your lungs partially ruptured, but it was just a prank, bro! You should've totally exhaled, dude!"</p>

			<p> Or would it be just too darned hard to log in? Facebook: "We see you're logging in from an unusual star system, we have sent a code to your email, enter it here to continue." Only you ticked off the Comms Specialist by beating them in poker so they are being a little bitch about it and blocking your email from penetrating the shield that is currently up because the Enterprise came across a Romulan Bird-of-Prey in the Neutral Zone.</p>
