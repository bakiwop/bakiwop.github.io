				<p><span class="title">Louisiana Bans School Prayer ... And God </span></p>
					<p>Louisiana's school prayer law has gone through many changes over the years since it was first passed in 1976. At first the law specified that students could, if they wished, take a moment of silent meditation.  The law was then amended in 1992 to include the word "prayer" and then amended again in 1999 to exclude the word "silent".</p>
					<p>The most recent ruling on the law comes from a federal appeals court - which stated that the law was unconstitutional and that school prayer, of any sort, should be banned.</p>
					<p>Judge Judy Penfield, who presided over the case, said, "This is a fair and just ruling. There are many issues involved here, not the least of which concerns the separation of church and state.  School is not the place to be praying. For instance, let's say a student, named Mike, overhears another student, named Mary, saying a quick prayer before a geometry test. What if Mike were to feel that Mary now had an unfair advantage on the test - what with getting the help of an omniscient and omnipotent entity and all. If God helps her, she'll for sure break the curve and Mike will be left with a "C" or maybe a "D" even though he may have gotten an 80% on the test. Also, what if Mike feels that his chances of succeeding on the test decrease because he is not offering up a prayer to God. Isn't it possible that God might get wrathful toward Mike for not worshipping him and make Mike fail?  That's just not right - school prayer is evil."</p>
					<p>"In fact, my ruling goes so far as to ban God from Louisiana schools outright - God Almighty is not allowed within 100 yards of any public school. Period. And, if this God-person doesn't watch it, I may find him in contempt of court. He seems to be causing a lot of fuss in the court systems lately what with wanting to be worshipped in school and other public places.  All of these cases about God in our courts is causing our judicial system to get back-logged. This is unacceptable. We have murderers and drug dealers to deal with, if this God-person really is omniscient and omnipotent, he can take care of these issues Himself.</p>
