For years, the ground under the Leaning Tower of Pisa had been giving way, so engineers had tied cables to it to keep it from falling while they reinforced the ground underneath. After years of renovations, the engineers removed the cables - but the tower still leans.<br /><br />"We do not understand what happened," said Antonio Buscelli, one of the engineers who worked on the tower. "We reinforced the ground just fine, the tower is no longer in danger of falling over, but the damn thing just won't go completely vertical."</p>
			<p><span class="title">Actually...</span><br />It turns out that money actually does grow on trees. Bill Gates, the billionaire from Microsoft was out planting trees in his backyard with his ten-year-old daughter.

He didn't have a good answer, so he and his little girl planted a $100 bill and waited a few months.  The $100 bill did indeed grow into a tree with $100 bills as leaves. "I'm just so happy I could cry," said Mr. Gates, "I mean, now I'll be even richer - how great a thing is that?"</p>

And God</a> - Louisiana's school prayer law has gone through many changes over the years since it was first passed in 1976. At first the law specified that students could, if they wished, take a moment of silent meditation. The law was then amended in 1992 to include the word "prayer" and then amended again in 1999 to exclude the word "silent". The most recent ruling on the law comes from a federal appeals court - which stated that the law was  ...</p>
