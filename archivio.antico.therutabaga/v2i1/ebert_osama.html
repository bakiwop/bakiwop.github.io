					<p>After viewing the Osama bin Laden tape, Ebert &amp; Roeper have given the tape a mediocre "1 thumb up".</p>
					<p>"I just didn't believe what he was saying," said Ebert, who gave the tape a 'thumb down', "I mean, he was entirely unconvincing in the role of a world-famous terrorist bent on the destruction of all capitalist societies. I didn't see any passion, I didn't see any desire. To me, he looked like he was just going through the motions of being a terrorist."</p>
					<p>"I have to disagree with you," said Roeper, who gave the tape a 'thumb up'. "The authenticity of the Arab garb, and the length of those beards really impressed me. I could totally see those guys killing capitalists and subjugating women. I thought it was very believable."</p>
					<p>"Well, to me," continued Ebert, "the tape played like a bad home movie.  The dialogue was stale, the lighting was terrible, and the supporting characters were completely useless - they didn't say ten words between them. It was as though they were just a sounding board for Osama's ideas on metallurgical theory and the like. It could have worked if Osama himself had been a more dynamic speaker, but frankly, he just bored the hell out of me."</p>
					<p>"I do have to agree with you there, Ebert," said Roeper, "the lighting and quality of the tape was horrible, but I think that the content of the tape more than made up for those shortcomings.  However, if Osama is going to want to play with the big boys like Tom Cruise or Jim Carey in the future, he is definitely going to have to think more about the quality of the movie instead of just the content. American audiences like high-quality settings and big special effects - I don't think just sitting in a small room talking to his associates is going to get him into the big leagues - this is no Oscar caliber production, that's for sure. There wasn't even a soundtrack. Next time out, this budding film maker is going to have to spend some of his millions to make a more "Hollywood-quality" film."</p>
