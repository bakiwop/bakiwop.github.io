					<p>Jill Williams was walking down the beach one day when she saw a wallet poking up out of the sand. When she picked it up, she saw that there was more than $50,000 in it - along with five credit cards, a driver's license, and a picture of a family.</p>
					<p>" It was great," she said. "I felt so lucky!  $50,000! Plus 5 credit cards!  I thought I was the luckiest woman in the world. I used the cash to buy myself a Cadillac - a pink one - and then I started charging plane tickets and clothes and extravagant dinners with the credit cards.  For two weeks I was in heaven!"</p>
					<p>But that heaven quickly turned to hell when Mark Stevens, the owner of the wallet, realized he had lost it and reported it to the police.  The police tracked the credit card charges back to Ms. Williams, and Mr. Stevens filed suit against her to reclaim the money he had lost.</p>
					<p>The two met for the first time, one month later, in the Coullee County courtroom.</p>
					<p>"Bitch!" he said.</p>
					<p>"Bastard!" she replied.</p>
					<p>Ms. Williams, who chose to represent herself in the case, began the trial with her opening statement, "Finders keepers, losers weepers. Thank you for your time," she said to the jury.</p>
					<p>Mr. Stevens, who also chose to represent himself - citing that he could no longer afford an attorney to prosecute the defendant - completely neglected to address the jury with his opening statement. Instead, he walked over to Ms. Williams' table and stated, "I'm gonna get you you mean lady!" He then put his hands to his ears and started waving them about while dancing in a circle and yelling, "Nyah nyah nyah nyah nyah nyah!"</p>
					<p>The trial lasted three days, and in the end, the jury decided that neither the defendant or the plaintiff was competent to stand trial and sentenced them both to five years of psychotherapy.</p>
					<p>Judge Dilbert Jones had this to say, "I think the jury made a wise decision.  Both Ms. Williams and Mr. Stevens were pretty loony.  Thank God good judgment prevailed - maybe now they can both be given the help they so sorely need."</p>
					<p>It was later determined that the family in Mr. Stevens' wallet was not his family - it was the one that came with the wallet.</p>
