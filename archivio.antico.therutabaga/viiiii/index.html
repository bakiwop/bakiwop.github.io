			<p><span class="title">Boy After First Kiss: Girls Are Oogie</span><br />Billy Thompson, an 11 year old boy from Beijing, had his first kiss yesterday. "I was pretty worried about getting girl germs," said Billy, "I mean, that was a pretty big concern." Billy said that his first kiss wasn't too bad, but he doesn't see what the big deal is about. "I always see people kissing in movies and on t.v., they look like they are having a real good time. But the kiss tasted kind of funny to me, I think girls are oogie."   When asked if he would kiss a girl again soon he said, "No. They don't taste very good."</p>
			<p><span class="title">Police Say Possession, Man Says Consumption</span><br />Two Hollywood men were arrested for possession with intent to sell late Sunday night.  The police officer had initially pulled over Fred Lawson and Craig Hammersley for speeding, but when he started talking to the two men, he smelled marijuana in the car.  A search of the vehicle revealed just over 5 kilos of marijuana. When told that he was being arrested for possession with intent to sell, Mr. Lawson said, "Possession my ass!  It was consumption, pure and simple."</p>
			<p><span class="title">Man Talks With Fake British Accent</span><br />A London man is reputed to talk with a fake British accent. "It's really annoying," said a coworker. "He says he does it because he wants to sound superior and knowledgeable.  He says the British accent gives him class. We haven't been able to figure out why he uses a fake British accent though, I mean, he's actually British, why fake it? To tell the truth, he's always been a bit of a wanker."</p>
			<p><span class="title">Actually...</span><br />Theresa Matthers, a 28 year old woman from New York, actually did talk to the hand when her sister said, "Talk to the hand, leave a message at the wrist" while holding out her hand toward her sister.  Ms. Matthers said she did not, however, leave a message at the wrist.</p>
