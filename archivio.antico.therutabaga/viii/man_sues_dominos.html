				<p>A Minneapolis man filed suit against Domino's Pizza yesterday in what is believed to be the first of many possible lawsuits against the Domino's Pizza franchise.</p>
				<p>Edward Garfield, 28, had just finished watching his favorite show, Felicity, when he saw a commercial for Domino's Pizza. "I was kind of hungry," Garfield said, "and all of the sudden this commercial for Domino's came on. At the end of the commercial, they said, 'Get the door. It's Domino's.'. So I went to the front door and opened it, but nobody was there."</p>
				<p>Garfield then checked the back door, the side door, and the door leading to the garage of his two-bedroom home on the near north side of Minneapolis. "I was devastated," Garfield said. "I was so hungry, but there was no Domino's Pizza delivery person. I just broke down and cried."</p>
				<p>Garfield's lawyer, Timothy Hucksler, told us that Garfield is suing for criminal negligence, emotional distress, emotional abandonment, and false advertising. "This is a man," Hucksler stated at a press conference earlier this afternoon, "that was tricked into wanting a Domino's pizza. Sure, he was hungry before the commercial aired, but the commercial promised that Domino's Pizza was right outside the door, waiting to serve him. When he needed Domino's Pizza most, they weren't there for him. They will pay for that. They will pay dearly."</p>
				<p>Since that fateful October day, Garfield states he has lost faith and trust in those things he once held most dear. "I even broke up with my girlfriend. I mean, if I can't trust the word of a multi-billion dollar, multi-national conglomerate, whom can I trust?"</p>
				<p>Domino's Pizza could not be reached for comment.</p>
