<p>"It was amazing," said a bystander, "she really whipped him good!"</p><p>At 7:30pm police were called to Spago, the trendy Hollywood restaurant, concerning an altercation between a male and female patron. When they arrived they called paramedics to the scene to treat the male, later identified to be Carrot Top, who eventually had to be taken to St. Luke's Mercy Hospital for treatment of a broken arm, a broken rib, a broken nose, and a concussion.</p><p>According to the police report, at 7:00pm Alyssa Milano,  who plays "Eva Savelot" in the 1-800-COLLECT commercials and is star of such shows as <em>Who's The Boss</em> and <em>Charmed</em>, entered Spago to have dinner with a friend. Around 7:10pm Carrot Top, who plays a dweeb in the 1-800-CALLATT commercials and is star of absolutely nothing, entered Spago with what was assumed to be a prostitute.</p><p>"I have no idea how he actually could have gotten a date," said one officer who spoke on the condition of anonymity, "so we are currently working on the assumption that he paid for this woman."</p><p>It seems that around 7:20pm or so, a person seated near both Ms. Milano and Mr. Top was trying to make a collect call from his cell phone, and that's when the trouble began.</p><p>"Alyssa just got up, walked over to the man, and suggested he dial 1-800-COLLECT, but then Carrot Top saw what was happening - he looked a little pissed - and suggested to the man that he dial 1-800-CALLATT instead."</p><p>The situation apparently escalated form there.</p><p>"There was a lot of shouting back and forth, and then all of the sudden she popped him a good one, right in the nose," said Maude Richardson, a grandmother from Ohio who had gone to Spago to 'see the stars'. "After that, she did some back-flip flying kick and the next thing ya know, that poor, orange-haired guy was lying on the ground unconscious. It was all rather exciting!"</p><p>"This isn't the first time these two have had it out with each other" said Sergeant Smith of the LAPD. "There was a report of an altercation between the two just the other day at the Viper Room.  This is, however, the first time there has been physical violence between the two."</p><p>Alyssa Milano released this statement concerning the incident: "That orange-haired freak had it coming."</p><p>It assumed that Mr. Top will release a statement after he regains consciousness.</p>
