<p>Northwest Airlines released its third quarter earnings last week and surprised industry analysts by reporting net earnings of $19 million dollars. However, the $19 million net earnings include a $249 million grant that Northwest received from the federal Airline Stabilization Act. CEO Richard Anderson had this to say, “The September 11 attacks have produced some significant challenges – airport and airplane security, training our employees to handle a terrorist threat - but the most important challenge that we have had to overcome is that of paying our executive officers. I am happy to announce, that because of this 1/4 of a billion dollar grant, we have not had to cut any upper-management positions or salaries.”</p>
<p>Northwest Airlines recently laid off about 10,000 workers – mostly pilots, mechanics, and flight attendants. “We were a bit worried,“ said Anderson. “Many of our top salaried managers have kids that go to places like Harvard and Stanford. If we hadn’t laid off those 10,000 employees, some of us might have had to take pay cuts.”</p>
<p>When asked about the families of those laid off, Anderson said, “What? They don’t have kids that go to Harvard.”</p>
<p>"Look, since September 11, we have seen a decrease in the number of people who are flying. Since we have fewer people who are flying, doesn’t it make sense to cut the employees who cater to the passengers? Since there is a bit less work to do, doesn’t it make sense to cut the people that do the actual work?”</p>
<p>"Oh yes, I almost forgot, “ Anderson continued. “As per the agreement on our federal grant, I have to mention that I hope every American does their job by going out and spending a lot of money to help boost our economy. All you laid off people now have plenty of time to go shopping – so do it!”</p>
<p>"Thank goodness we don’t have to pay back any of that grant money!” </p>
