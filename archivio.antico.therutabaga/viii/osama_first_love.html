				<p><span class="title">Interview With Osama bin Laden's First Love</span></p>
				<p>Adeela Faruqi was Osama bin Laden's first love. She emigrated from Syria when she was 13 years old and is currently living in Pittsburgh PA, where she owns a beauty salon. Adeela talked to us about how she originally hooked up with Osama and why she eventually left him.</p>
				<p>Rutabaga: How long ago was it that you dated Osama?</p>
				<p>Adeela Faruqi: I think we dated back when I was 13 years old, that would have made him 14 at the time.</p>
				<p>R: How long did the two of you date?</p>
				<p>AF: Oh, it wasn't for too long. I'd say it was maybe two or three weeks. Yeah, that sounds about right.</p>
				<p>R: How did he ask you out?</p>
				<p>AF: Ha!  He was a pretty shy guy back then - not too experienced with the ladies. He had a friend hand me a big yellow envelope. Inside the envelope were two smaller envelopes and a note. The note read: "If you would like to go out with me check the box marked 'Yes', put this note in the blue envelope and give it to my friend. If you do not want to go out with me, check the box marked 'No', put this note in the red envelope with the harmless white substance in it which you can completely ignore and keep it as a remembrance of my love." How could I say no?</p>
				<p>R: Indeed! Did you ever ask what the white substance was?</p>
				<p>AF: No. At the time, I didn't think much of it at all.</p>
				<p>R: He asks you out, then what happens?</p>
				<p>AF: He called me a few days later to set up the date. He had his mom drive him to come pick me up. She drove us to this really fancy restaurant, he was a complete gentleman. He opened the doors for me, pulled out my chair, and even gave me his jacket when it got a little chilly. Afterwards we went for a walk on the beach. For the longest time he looked like he kept wanting to ask my permission for something, and then he said, "Would it be okay if I kissed you?" I was pretty excited and a bit scared!  I mean, I had never kissed a boy before. So he came closer to me, we looked into each other's eyes, and then it happened. We kissed.</p>
				<p>R: Was he a good kisser?</p>
				<p>AF: No. He didn't really know what he was doing. Like I said, he was pretty shy with the ladies, and it showed. He kept his eyes open the whole time and it really freaked me out. Then he tried something with his tongue, it was pretty bad. I started choking. Then I started laughing. I think he actually started crying a bit. I wasn't trying to be mean by laughing at him, but it was such a bad kiss! I was hoping for something really romantic, but that tongue thing just ruined for me.</p>
				<p>R: Ewww.</p>
				<p>AF: Yeah. It was bad. But after a little while he regained his composure. He walked me back to his mom's car and when she got to my home, he walked me to my door.</p>
				<p>R: Did he try and kiss you again?</p>
				<p>AF: No. We never kissed after that. He just asked me out again. I felt so bad for him that I said, "Yes." We went out three more times, but then my parents told me we were moving and I told him. He asked me out on one last date, it was the night before I was leaving for America. After dinner, we went for another walk and he broke down crying, saying how much he hated America for taking me away from him and how he would make it his life's goal to punish them. I thought it was all rather cute and a bit flattering at the time, now I just think it's horribly creepy.</p>
