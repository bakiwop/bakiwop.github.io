					<p>Freddie Walker, a Newport, NJ man, tried to make a deal with the devil early Monday morning. Walker drew a pentagram on the floor of his apartment and started speaking in tongues, chanting, and singing evil love songs (most based upon REO Speedwagon tunes) to try an entice the devil to help him win the upcoming New Jersey state lottery drawing. "I really went all out," said Walker. "I did a little dance, did some singing, some chanting - and all of the sudden, the devil appeared.  I was like, 'bitchin'."</p>
					<p>Walker made his plea to the devil. I said, "Devil-dude.  If you make me win the lottery, I will like totally give you my soul."</p>
					<p>The devil smirked a bit, poked Walker with his pitchfork, and said, "Hell no!"</p>
					<p>"I was like totally sad," said Walker.</p>
					<p>The devil, it seems as been doing a booming business in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. "I don't really have a need for anymore souls," said the prince of darkness. "I'm pretty much booked up through the end of the next millennium."</p>
					<p>"These last few years have been good to me," continued the devil. "I made all those dot-com millionaires when they promised me their souls and then took away all their money in the economic recession.  I have all those Taliban people coming down here in a few years. I have politicians up the wazoo.  Heads of state. Heads of companies. Oh yeah, and my personal favorite, Martha Stewart. I'm pretty much set for a while."</p>
					<p>The devil offered some tips in order to better entice him when you try to sell your soul. "That doesn't mean that you should stop trying to sell me your souls, though. Make you offer interesting! These Walker-guys are a dime a dozen.  Everybody wants to sell me their soul to win the lottery - I'm bored with that. Be creative when you ask for something, be unique! You might just get your deal after all!"</p>
