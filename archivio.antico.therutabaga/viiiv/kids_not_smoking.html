					<p>America's teen-agers are smoking much less than they have in the past, and officials attribute the decline to an aggressive marketing campaign paid for by the settlements of lawsuits reached with the tobacco industry. Federal officials said the drop in teen smoking validates the approach of Target Market and other nationwide youth tobacco-prevention programs started in 2000. Target Market employs unconventional techniques that don't stress the health risks posed by cigarettes as much as show young people how tobacco companies have tried to market to them even though they are too young to legally smoke.</p>
					<p>"I didn't care that the tobacco companies were poisoning me and making me addicted to their product on purpose," said Emily Frank, a high school senior who recently quit smoking because of the ads, "but when I learned they were marketing to me directly - woo, that really pissed me off."</p>
					<p>The percentage of ninth-graders who said they had smoked in the past month dropped from 30.3 percent in 1998 to 18.7 percent this spring, according to the results of the 2001 Federal Student Survey released today. Other survey results showed promising, though smaller, declines for other risky youth behavior such as drinking alcohol and having sex. </p>
					<p>Alcohol use declined, continuing a trend seen throughout the 1990s. Less than 15 percent of sixth-graders this year said they drank alcohol in the past 12 months, compared with 25 percent in 1992. For 12th-graders, 67.5 percent said they drank alcohol -- a drop of 2 percentage points from 1998 and a 12-point drop from 1992. </p>
					<p>Sexual activity showed small declines that also continued trends started in the 1990s. Less than 49 percent of 12th-graders said they had had sexual intercourse, a drop of 1.6 percentage points from 1998 and 14 points from 1989. Less than 20 percent of ninth-graders reported having sexual intercourse, a drop from 30 percent in 1989.</p>
					<p>"Basically what we are seeing here is that kids are less fun than they were a decade ago," said Martha Thompson, one of the researchers who worked on the survey project. "Today's kids are really boring. They are pretty un-cool. I remember when I was a kid, having sex, drinking, and smoking pot were some of my favorite activities, but try telling that to kids these days - they just don't listen."</p>
