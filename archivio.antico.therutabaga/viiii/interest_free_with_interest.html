					<p>"Oh!  I'm so happy....so happy! What a great deal!"</p>
					<p>The above words have been heard all around America as consumers flock to car dealerships to trade in their old, perfectly functioning cars for new, perfectly functioning cars as American car companies continue with their zero percent interest rate programs in the wake of the September 11 tragedy.</p>
					<p>Guy Amato, spokesperson for Ford Motor Company's "Drive America" plan explains, "You see, Ford Motor Company is offering 36-month, zero percent APR Ford financing on all 2001 and 2002 Ford vehicles. Ford. Ford is calling this the "Drive America" plan. Ford. What this means to the Ford consumer is that Ford will give you a Ford car, with zero percent APR. Ford. Why is Ford doing this? Ford. Ford is doing this because Ford wants all Americans to get out and do their patriotic duty by spending money on consumer goods and services. Amen. Ford."</p>
					<p>When asked if there were any restrictions on the zero percent financing, Guy responded, "No." and then asked us to come a little closer by waving us toward him.</p>
					<p>"This is all off the record, right?" he asked.</p>
					<p>"Okay then, here's the real deal. You see, this zero percent interest rate thingy that we have been heavily promoting through television commercials and magazines is only available to <em>qualified buyers</em> - meaning that the person has to have excellent credit, which almost no one does, which means that almost no one qualifies!"</p>
					<p>"So we get all these people to come  in thinking that they'll qualify for a "zero percent" APR when they really won't and they end up paying the normal 8-12% APR - isn't that great?!"</p>
					<p>"Not only that, but for every $1000 financed through Ford for the 36 month, zero percent APR "Drive America" program, consumers who <em>do</em> qualify will pay $27.07 - or an APR of 2.7%.  So even the people who qualify for the "zero percent" APR don't get a zero percent APR.  We just call the 2.7% a tragedy sucker charge, I mean a tragedy surcharge, instead of a finance charge."</p>
					<p>"Finally, and this one really kills me, we don't include any other offers! So, for instance, if you want to get the "cash back" option, or if you want to lease a car, you get to pay normal percentage rates!  Isn't that great? What a bunch of suckers!"</p>
					<p>"Can I go back on the record now?"</p>
					<p>"So to all you patriotic Americans out there - go out and buy a new car! Do it for your country! Do it for those who suffered because of the September 11 tragedy! With you spending, and us taking your money, we can, all of us, make America great again. Spend! God Bless America! Amen!"</p>
					<p>"Ford."</p>
