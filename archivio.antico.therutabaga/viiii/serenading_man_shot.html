				<p>A man was shot just outside of Paris, France - in the small town of Boulogne - on Saturday night.</p>
				<p>Police reports say that Rainer Ledoyen had been serenading Stephanie Adjani for just over five hours when a neighbor got fed up and fired a handgun 22 times at the would-be paramour.</p>
				<p>"I just couldn't take it anymore," said Herbet Conocescheau, who is being held on an attempted manslaughter charge. "At first it was kind of cute, here was a man trying to win the love a girl by singing songs to her and playing the guitar. How romantic! But after a half an hour, when Stephanie didn't let him in, I went over to him and asked him to stop - it was 11:30 at night for goodness sake! I was tired! But he said 'No, I will not leave this spot or stop playing until I win the love of my sweet Stephanie!'"</p>
				<p>According to several eye witnesses M. Conocescheau then went back to his home, shaking his head.</p>
				<p>"I tried going back to sleep," continued M. Conocescheau, "but I couldn't! He wasn't really very good in the first place, and after a few hours, he just got worse. He kept singing the same songs over and over again, and Stephanie still hadn't let him in. I was getting pretty upset, so I stormed over to him and demanded he stop! He just said, 'No, I will not leave this spot or stop playing until I win the love of my sweet Stephanie!' Even when I threatened his life he would not change his mind!  I admired that and left, trying  block the sound of his awful singing out of my mind"</p>
				<p>After 2 more hours, it seems that M. Conocescheau could take it no longer.  He grabbed his gun and went out, insisting that M. Ledoyen cease his futile attempts for the night and try again later. When M. Ledoyen replied, "No, I will not leave this spot or stop playing until I win the love of my sweet Stephanie!" M. Conocescheau fired at him 22 times, hitting him only twice.</p>
				<p>"Thank goodness I am not a very good shot! I fired all those times, but hit him only twice - I was so relieved that I hadn't killed him - but part of me wishes that I had!  I mean, he was a really bad singer!"</p>
				<p>It turns out that the reason Mme. Adjani did not let M. Ledoyen in was because she was out of the country on business - she is not expected back until early next week.</p>
				<p>M. Ledoyen is expected to fully recover from his wounds.</p>
