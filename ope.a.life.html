<p>7th grade basketball game. Player steps on my foot. Pain is so bad I sit in closest stands and cry. For two hours. In my uniform. Nobody comes to help until my parents pick me up. X-ray shows multiple metatarsal fractures.</p>

<p>NHL players are totes adorbs. They group hug for celebrations, chew their mouth guards like pacifiers, and every once in a while they throw a big tantrum and get put in a timeout.</p>

<p>I interviewed for a programmer position at a life insurance company. Because that's how desperate I was for a job. The final question? "What are five things you can do with a <a href="https://www.dixie.com">Dixie Cup</a>?"</p>
<p>"Really?" I said.</p>

<a id="0000000004"></a>
<p>During the first month of COVID lockdown, I took to eating a bowl of cereal by the big picture window in the morning. I frequently saw the UPS guy. We'd wave and smile. One day he had a delivery for me. I opened the door. Big smiles. He tried handing me the package. My smile faltered. His smile faltered. He put the package on the stoop. I stopped eating cereal by the big picture window.</p>

<p>"Yeah. It's some fancy to-do at a house on the Gold Coast."</p>
<p>"..."</p>
<p>"So I'll drive back Saturday morning. The formal is Saturday night."</p>

<a id="0000000001"></a>
<p>My parents needed a car. They took me along with them to a Pontiac dealership. I was nine. The car salesman asked me if I wanted to meet <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KITT">K.I.T.T.</a>.</p>
<p>Yes!</p>
<p>He led me to a car on the sales floor. There was no red flashy thing scrolling back and forth at the front. There were no cool dash lights reading "guidance system" and "ignitors." There was no "rocket boost" or "grappling hook" button. No Atari-looking steering wheel. The car didn't talk.</p>
<p>The salesman wouldn't stop smiling.</p>
