<blockquote>
<p>The program represents an about-face from policies that for years focused on short-term group shelters and the ceaseless shuffle of encampments from one city block to the next. That system made it difficult to keep people who were scattered through the city connected to services and on the path to permanent housing.</p>
<p>Those services in Denver’s and Atlanta’s micro communities are largely centralized. They offer residents case management, counseling, mental health and substance abuse therapy, housing guidance and assistance obtaining anything from vocational skills training to a new pair of dentures.</p>
<p>“We’re able to meet every level of the hierarchy of needs — from security and shelter, all the way up to self-actualization and the sense of community,” said Peter Cumiskey, the Atlanta site clinician.</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>The case itself originated from parent complaints that books in the Llano County public library system showed "butts and farts," prompting local officials to instruct the library director to take the books off shelves. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
	<p>Seven library patrons sued to reinstate the books, claiming the censorship violated the First Amendment. After a district court sided with the patrons and Llano residents appealed, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld an injunction to reinstate the offending titles, ordering the books should return to shelves within 24 hours.</p>
	<p>"Librarians may consider books’ contents in making curation decisions," judges ruled. "Their discretion, however, must be balanced against patrons’ First Amendment rights... a book may not be removed for the sole—or a substantial— reason that the decisionmaker does not wish patrons to be able to access the book’s viewpoint or message."</p>

<p><a href="https://www.mlive.com/news/ann-arbor/2016/06/saving_man_from_beating_at_kkk.html">Former Ann Arbor resident reflects on saving man from beating at KKK rally</a></p>
<blockquote>
	<p>Some moments have a way of defining us, Keshia Thomas said, whether we're ready for them or not. Thomas' moment came under unexpected circumstances - crouched over a white supremacist sympathizer, providing a human shield from anti-Ku Klux Klan protesters who began attacking him at a rally 20 years ago.</p>
	<p>The image of Thomas, then an 18-year-old black teenager living in Ann Arbor, protecting the man decked in a confederate flag shirt and sporting an SS tattoo, has become an iconic symbol of peace and altruistic virtue for many over the past two decades.</p>
	<p>"We all have a conscience and it was my responsibility to do what I felt was right," Thomas said in a phone interview on June 23, the day after the 20-year anniversary of the incident.</p>
	<p>Thomas, who now resides in Houston, learned McKeel Jr. died a couple of months ago when McKeel's son called to inform her, putting his 12-year-old sister on the line to tell her she might not be alive if it hadn't been for Thomas' actions that day. "When I heard that, I thought this was the future and the past of what peace has created," Thomas said. "The real accomplishment of all this to me is to know that his son and daughter don't share the same views. History didn't repeat itself. That's what gives me hope that the world can get better from generation to generation."</p>
	<p>"I think of my actions the same way I felt about them 20 years ago," she said. "You don't want to grow older and be bitter and more cynical. You want to keep those child-like ideals of innocence and justice. I still maintain those same views and I'm not jaded by the way things are now."</p>
