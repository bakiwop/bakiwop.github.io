					<blockquote><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=2DIRHtD0u3c">22nd Annual Northwest Public Employees Diversity Conference</a>: this is why we have to talk about race, because there is the reality of being a person of color in this country and dealing with racism every day that lives in peoples' bodies and causes them immense pain and trauma, and in fact the DSM-V has recategorized racial trauma and racism in the same context as PTSD - Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. </blockquote>
					<blockquote>And this has to be clear, I suffered not a horrific, singular, giant, violent event around my race, this is: I got up in the morning, I brushed my teeth, I went to work, I bought my lunch, I went to a movie, I came home, I watched some tv, I went to bed, and that is racial trauma and that is in the same category as PTSD because I did all of that while being a person of color in a racist society.</blockquote>
					<blockquote>And that reality, that post traumatic stress of living with racism every day, is living in peoples' bodies and killing them and killing the next generation as well.</blockquote>
					<blockquote>And we have to realize that this is not something that came out of nowhere. we have to realize this is rooted in history. </blockquote>

Inferior education, poor housing, unemployment, inadequate health care - each is a bitter component of the oppression that has been our heritage. Each will require billions of dollars to correct. Justice so long deferred has accumulated interest and its cost for this society will be substantial in financial as well as human terms. This fact has not been fully grasped, because most of the gains of the past decade were obtained at bargain rates. The desegregation of public facilities cost nothing; neither did the election and appointment of a few black public officials.</blockquote>

					We got around to the subject of war again and I said that, contrary to his attitude, I did not think that the common people are very thankful for leaders who bring them war and destruction. 
						<br /><br />
					Why, of course, the people don't want war, Goering shrugged. Why would some poor slob on a farm want to risk his life in a war when the best that he can get out of it is to come back to his farm in one piece. Naturally, the common people don't want war; neither in Russia nor in England nor in America, nor for that matter in Germany. That is understood. But, after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a Parliament or a Communist dictatorship. 
						<br /><br />
					There is one difference, I pointed out. In a democracy the people have some say in the matter through their elected representatives, and in the United States only Congress can declare war. 
						<br /><br />
					Oh, that is all well and good, but, voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same way in any country.

					<blockquote>Wage inequality captures the gap between wage-earning individuals. Let's shift our attention to a more common measure (for the study of inequality) of income. Income includes non-wage forms of income like return on investment or capital gains, and it groups individuals (depending on the way in which the data is collected) into families, households, or tax units</blockquote>
					<blockquote>For the first 30 years after World War II, income for all groups closely tracked the expansion of the postwar economy. We were growing together. For the last 30 years, the gains have been starkly unequal: As productivity and incomes for higher earners continued to rise, the incomes of this in the middle and lower percentiles flattened off. </blockquote>
					<blockquote>The magnitude of that redistribution is driven home by recent research from the Congressional Budget Office [see FIG below]. From 1979 to 2007, the after-tax incomes of the poorest 20 percent grew very little, gaining almost nothing in real (inflation-adjusted) value from 1979 to the mid-1990s and inching up during the late 1990s - for a net gain of about 15 percent. Incomes for the middle 60 percent of workers echoed this trend - while the next richest 19 percent did a little better. But the lion's share has gone to the top 1 percent--whose incomes over that span have almost tripled.</blockquote>

					the Luddites – who took their name from the mythological General Ned Ludd, whose legend included the smashing of weaving-frames – were engaged in the most science-fictional exercise imaginable – asking not what a technology does, but who it does it to and who it does it for.
					<br /><br />
					All that was threatened by the advent of textile machines, which produced more fabric in less time, and required less skill. The owners of textile factories bought these machines with profits derived from the weavers' labor, and then used those machines to grind down the weavers. Their hours got longer, their pay got shorter, and many of them were maimed or killed by the new machines.
					<br /><br />
					Here's where the science fiction part comes in. If you were a Martian looking through a telescope at Earth, it would not be obvious to you that these new weaving machines should benefit factory owners, rather than workers. There's nothing inevitable about that arrangement. The machines could just as easily have shortened weavers' working hours, increased their hourly pay, and made more fabric available at lower prices to the public.

Unlike other butterflies that can overwinter as larvae, pupae, or even as adults in some species, monarchs cannot survive the cold winters of northern climates. Using environmental cues, the monarchs know when it is time to travel south for the winter. Monarchs use a combination of air currents and thermals to travel long distances.

					<blockquote>The racial gap in earnings, incomes and wealth reflects the long shadow of slavery, and the persistence of racial discrimination in employment, politics, education, housing, credit, and criminal justice.</blockquote>
					<blockquote>African-Americans also have a much more tenuous foothold in the labor market, their unemployment rate, across the last business cycle, running more than double that of whites. It is true of incomes, where the median for black families has grown alongside that of white families since the 1960s - but without closing the gap between them (black median income reached 60 percent of white median income at the end of the 1960s; that ratio has not budged since [see FIG below]).</blockquote>
					<blockquote>And it is dramatically true of wealth, where the legacy of deep discrimination in housing continues to shape the accumulated assets, or net worth, of African-American families. [see FIG below] The median wealth of white households is about twenty times that of black households, a ratio that is actually higher now than it was a generation ago. Fully one quarter of African-American families have no net assets. And the housing crash hit African-American families hard, pushing homeownership rates back below 45 percent.</blockquote>
					<blockquote>The close ties between race and inequality have been tightened in recent decades by the dramatic and devastating rise in incarceration rates (click here for a nice graphical summary). The U.S. incarceration rate more than tripled from 1980 to 2008 - and in a startlingly uneven fashion: African Americans are incarcerated at 7 times the rate of white Americans. In 2008, over a third of black men between the ages of 20 and 34 were incarcerated. More than two-thirds of African-American men without a high school education born between 1975 and 1979 had a prison record by 2008. </blockquote>
					<blockquote>The impact of incarceration on inequality is hidden (those in prison are left uncounted by conventional measures of unemployment or poverty) but profound. Higher rates of imprisonment reflect not higher rates of crime, but an increasingly intensive policing or urban neighborhoods and institutions (including schools) and increasingly draconian sentencing laws. This, in turn, has served to exaggerate disadvantages based on race, place, and education. Jail suspends employment and income prospects for the period of incarceration, and undermines over the long haul for those who are released. Family members and dependents left behind fall into deeper poverty - and are themselves more likely as a result to end up behind bars. Mass incarceration, now accompanied by a vast prison-industrial complex, undercuts the bargaining power of "free" labor. And the systematic disenfranchisement of felons further skews the political reflection of racial and economic inequality.</blockquote>

					<blockquote>Workers in the 10 most populous states, home to about half of the country’s total workforce, are being cheated out of $8 billion annually. If these findings hold true for the other half of the U.S. workforce, it would mean that bad employers across the country are stealing around $15 billion annually from their employees just from minimum wage violations alone.</blockquote>
					<blockquote>It is worth noting that this number, $15 billion, exceeds the value of property crimes committed in the United States each year: according to the FBI, the total value of all robberies, burglaries, larceny, and motor vehicle theft in the United States in 2015 was $12.7 billion (FBI 2016; Meixell &amp; Eisenbrey 2014). Property crime is a better understood, more tangible form of crime than wage theft, and federal, state, and local governments spend tremendous resources to combat it. In contrast, lawmakers in much of the country allocate little, if any, resources to fighting wage theft, yet the cost of wage theft is at least comparable to—and likely much higher than—the cost of property crime. (It is important to note that our estimate doesn’t include all forms of wage theft: if minimum wage violations total $15 billion on their own, it is likely the full cost of all forms of wage theft—including failure to pay overtime, misclassification, off-the-clock violations, illegal deductions, and others—dwarfs the cost of property crime.)</blockquote>

"You want to know what this was really all about?" he asked with the bluntness of a man who, after public disgrace and a stretch in federal prison, had little left to protect. "The Nixon campaign in 1968, and the Nixon White House after that, had two enemies: the antiwar left and black people. You understand what I'm saying? We knew we couldn't make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities.

					<blockquote>The top 1 percent claim about a third of the nation's wealth [see FIG below]. The top 5 percent claim over 60 percent. The top 10 percent claim over 70 percent. The top 20 percent claim over 80 percent. The next two percentiles - those falling between the richest 20 percent and poorest 40 percent - together claim a little more than 10 percent. Leaving the poorest 40 percent with a share of national wealth that is nearly imperceptible on the chart.  </blockquote>
					<blockquote>This inequality has been attenuated in recent years, since housing is (or was) the main source of wealth for middle-income American families. Between 2007 and 2010 alone [see FIG below], those in the broad middle class (between the 20th and 60th income percentiles) saw their family wealth slip almost 40 percent.  The recession hit the wealthy hard, but they rebounded quickly: by 2011, the richest 5 percent were back were they were in 2003, while net worth for the median household had fallen by half over the same span.</blockquote>
					<blockquote>Consider the latest data on patterns in global wealth, from Credit Suisse's 2012 Global Wealth Report. Of the 166 countries included in the report, the United States is - unsurprisingly - one of the wealthiest, with a mean (average) wealth-per-adult of about $260,000 - making it the 7th richest nation on that list...A more telling benchmark is median wealth - the point at which half adult American are worth more and half are worth less. On this metric, the United States (at only about $39,000) drops to 27th. Indeed the yawning gap between the mean and the median is pretty good measure of wealth inequality. If average wealth is $260,000, but half of all adults have a net worth of less than $39,000, a lot of wealth is being hoarded at the very top.</blockquote>
