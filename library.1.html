		<p>I upset a patron the other day. A teen with their mother. They were all over the nonfiction section, occasionally stopping to look at the catalog on their phone, finding then pulling book after book. After awhile they'd amassed a sizable pile to lug around.</p>
		<p>They didn't seem to need my help and I was happy not to give it.</p>
		<p>A bit later they walked up to my desk and said they couldn't find one. I asked for the title. The patron told me, and as I typed it into my search they said, "I have it right here." I looked up. They were holding their phone out to me. There it was, the book in our catalog.</p>
		<p>"Fantastic," I said. I turned back to my computer, turned the screen so they could see it, and continued searching.</p>
		<p>"But I have it right here," they said.</p>
		<p>I looked up, smiled, and told them I had access to a slightly different catalog.</p>
		<p>Cue betrayal face.</p>
		<p>I pointed to the screen to show them when the book had last been checked in (today) and told them it was probably over in circ waiting to hop on one of the shelving carts. Said they should give me a couple moments and I'd go check.</p>
		<p>As I got up from the desk, the patron looked at their mother and said, "that's cheating." Mom smiled sympathetically.</p>
		<p>I found the book and handed it to the patron. The look they gave me makes me fear I may have just started them on their villain arc.</p>

		<p>Library Courier is a very dangerous job in the library world. Shuttling books back and forth ain’t for the faint of heart. As you can see from the picture below, the courier needs protection from the library books. It’s not that the books are evil as such, but they are off the shelf and away from their friends which means they’re scared, confused, and likely to attack until they find themselves back in a library or in the hands of a patron.</p>
		<p>Nothing is better to a library book than being in the hands of a patron.</p>
		<p>This van just had new security equipment installed but the courier is far braver than I, those books could muscle through those bars at any moment and do some serious damage.</p>

		<p>I was headed to lunch when I saw a coworker at the circ desk shaking something in their hand. "Come on over," they said, "I need your help."</p>
		<p>I moseyed over and saw they were holding a cube. 2 inches by 2 inches by 2 inches. Hollow except for the 1/2 inch tall plastic bottom on the inside with three concentric, ridged circles and a metal ball about a 1/4 inch around. It was a child's game. The goal was to get the metal sphere to sit in the smallest, center circle.</p>
		<p>"Do you know how to solve this?" They asked.</p>
		<p>I grabbed it. Shook it. Failed to solve it. "'fraid not. Sorry, I've never been any good at those kinds of puzzles." I looked closely at my coworker. "You look like you need a break from it, though. Want me to take it off your hands for an hour or so? Kid's toy timeout?"</p>
		<p>The coworker looked relieved. "Take it home and don't bring it back," they said, then handed it to me.</p>
		<p>I turned, shook it, and the ball fell into the center circle, so I made a detour and placed the game on the coworkers chair before heading out for lunch.</p>
