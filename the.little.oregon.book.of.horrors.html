<p>Jim stopped the truck where the forest road ended and the hiking trail started. There was a small, hand painted sign that read: Trail Head.</p>
<p>"I have got to get a picture of that!" said Ryan. He grabbed his phone, hopped out of the truck, and took a couple pics.</p>
<p>"You've had to 'get a picture of that' for just about everything so far," said Jim, smiling as he turned the ignition off and got out.</p>
<p>They went to the back of the truck to grab their gear.</p>
<p>"I've been looking forward to this for years!" said Ryan. "Years! Come on! Open up! Open up!"</p>
<p>"You're practically vibrating," Jim replied, going through his jumble of keys. He eventually found the right one, unlocked the truck topper, and opened the tailgate.</p>
<p>"So exciting!" Ryan shouted. He snatched his backpack from the truck and got it on in record time. He looked at Jim and smiled. "Oregon! Woo!"</p>
<p>Jim looked sidelong at his new friend while grabbing the extra water. "You do have forests in Wisconsin."</p>
<p>"Yeah, but not like this!" Ryan gripped his backpack's straps, sighed, and looked up. It was a beautiful summer day in the Coastal range. The deep blue sky was framed by towering Sitka spruce whose trunks were swallowed by the ferns mobbing the forest floor. There wasn't a level piece of ground in sight. A cool breeze blew off the Pacific. "I can't believe its freakin' August! Do you know what the temp and humidity are in Wisconsin right now? 95!"</p>
<p>"Is that the temp or the humidity?" asked Jim.</p>
<p>"Both!"</p>
<p>"That," Jim said, grabbing his backpack and buckling it on, "truly sucks."</p>
<p>"It's reason number three hundred twenty seven why I wanted to move out here."</p>
<p>"Well," Jim said, grabbing a fanny pack and slamming the tailgate shut, "now that you're finally out here, let's get going on your first PNW hike." He clipped the fanny pack around his waist, shrugged his backpack a couple of times to get it seated properly, then gestured for Ryan to lead the way.</p>
<p>The two of them spent the next couple hours hiking – gaining and losing hundreds upon hundreds of feet of elevation. </p>
<p>"The views! The drop-offs!" said Ryan for the hundredth time that day.  The-"</p>
<p>"-water breaks," finished Jim. He stopped, shrugged off his pack, grabbed two waters, and handed one to Ryan.</p>
<p>"Stupid beautiful," said Ryan, drinking. He wiped some sweat off his brow with his tee. "This is all just so stupid beautiful."</p>
<p>They found places to sit and drink their water while they enjoyed the quiet psithurism of the wind blowing through the trees and the burble of the water flowing around rocks in the nearby creek.</p>
<p>After a bit, they got up and brushed themselves off. Ryan tossed his empty water bottle to Jim, who utterly and completely failed to catch it.</p>
<p>"Dude," said Ryan walking toward him, picking up the water bottle. "Fast hands." He tried to hand it to him, but Jim's hand wouldn't close around the bottle. Ryan looked at him more closely, all the blood had drained from Jim's face and he was trembling ever so slightly. "Jim? Hey Jim!" He waved his hands in front of Jim's face. "Earth to Jim!" He snapped his fingers.</p>
<p>Jim grabbed Ryan's hands so quickly he didn't see them move.</p>
<p>"Shh...shsshshhhh...shh...shsh," Jim managed through gritted teeth. </p>
<p>Ryan tried to catch Jim's eye. "Hey! Hey! What's wrong? Do you have a medical cond-"</p>
<p>Jim let go of Ryan's hands and grabbed his shoulders - he felt like he was being gripped by two overly-tightened vices – then spun him around.</p>
<p>Ryan got as far as,"Come on, man! What's going o-,"  before he saw the mama bear and two cubs thirty feet away from them, stopped on the trail where Ryan and Jim had just come from.</p>
<p>The bears were staring at them.</p>
<p>"Shit!" Whispered Ryan.</p>
<p>"Yes," Jim whispered back. "Shit."</p>
<p>"What are we gonna do, man?"</p>
<p>"Don't make any sudden moves. You'll startle them. Don't run. Their prey drive will kick in and they can run faster than Usain Bolt. You cannot outrun them. Don't try to climb a tree. They can climb trees almost as fast as they can run."</p>
<p>"Jesus Christ! Then what the hell are we supposed to do."</p>
<p>"Don't worry. I brought a...deterrent."</p>
<p>The bear cubs were getting curious and started toward the two hikers. Momma bear was decidedly unhappy with this turn of events and began huffing. </p>
<p>"Okay. I'm gonna grab something from my fanny pack, then we have to rush toward the bears making ourselves as big as we can while yelling at the top of our lungs."</p>
<p>"That," said Ryan, "does not sound like it should be Plan A." He felt Jim remove his hands from his shoulders. He heard a zipper being opened slowly. He heard a snick followed by Jim mumbling something that sounded like, 'not again.' He heard another snick then risked a look back. Jim was holding a revolver.</p>
<p>"You're gonna shoot them?" asked Ryan. "You can't just shoot them!"</p>
<p>"I would never shoot a bear," responded Jim. "Besides, this is just a little .22. It'd just tick 'em off."</p>
<p>"So why-"</p>
<p>"Alright, on the count of three, we're gonna rush the bears."</p>
<p>"But-"</p>
<p>"One."</p>
<p>"Are you sure? This doesn't-"</p>
<p>"Two."</p>
<p>"I don't know if I can-"</p>
<p>"Remember. Make yourself big and loud."</p>
<p>"Okay," whimpered Ryan.</p>
<p>The cubs continued to slowly make their way toward the hikers. Momma bear started pounding her front paws on the ground and clacking her teeth between huffs.</p>
<p>"Three!" shouted Jim.</p>
<p>Ryan roared. He threw his arms out and flapped them like he was trying to fly. He hopped toward the bears and screamed, "Go away, bears! Go away, scary bears!"</p>
<p>The cubs ran back toward their mother. Momma bear's lower lip protruded and her ears flattened.</p>
<p>Ryan shouted. "I think it's working!" He glanced back at Jim, who was pointing the gun at his leg. Ryan stopped his flapping, hopping, yelling advance and, through his confusion, said, "Wha-?" </p>
<p>"That was really something," said Jim. His face broke into an agonized rictus. His eyes wide and unblinking. "I'm," his voice broke. "I'm so sorry," he whispered. He pulled the trigger.</p>
<p>Ryan heard a pop and felt a burning sting in his calf. He collapsed, grabbed his calf, and started screaming. </p>
<p>Momma bear charged.</p>
<p>Jim stood still for a moment and watched, then turned and ran for all he was worth. <em>Lucky for me,</em> he thought, <em>I don't have to outrun the bear.</em></p>
<p>Ryan felt an immense pressure, first on his back, then on his right shoulder. <em>Huh,</em> he thought, <em>just like having wisdom teeth pulled – all pressure, no pain.</em> He was violently jerked around then dropped. He felt lightheaded. Confused. He was annoyed by a high-pitched wailing, then astonished to discover he was the one making it. His vision blurred then cleared. He saw his arm lying on the trail a couple feet away. "That," he wheezed, spitting up foamy blood bubbles, "is not right." He wished for his vision to blur again. He felt more pressure on his back, then heard cracking and crunching. <em>Ah,</em> he thought while passing out, <em>there's the pain.</em></p>
<p>Momma bear sniffed around the unconscious Ryan then gathered up her cubs and headed down the trail the way they'd come. Ryan came to in time to see the bears round a bend in the trail and disappear from sight. <em>Who knew bear butts were furry?</em> he thought. <em>Furry bear butts! Furry bear butts!</em> Ryan started giggling, or at least he felt like giggling, but his crushed lungs would not allow him the breath to do it, so he just ended up convulsing for a moment. <em>Furry bear butts!</em> He tried getting up but couldn't move his arm or his legs. <em>Can't move my other arm either!</em> he thought, which caused more convulsions. His vision started tunneling. He felt an infinitely increasing weariness and detachment. <em>Oregon. Woo,</em> he thought. </p>
<p>Ryan had one, final, overwhelming urge to live. All people from Wisconsin experience it when they're about to die. <em>I'm never gonna eat cheese again,</em> he thought. His body and mind rebelled at such a horrible and alien concept, but nonetheless, not even the power of cheese was enough.</p>
<p>Ryan died.</p>

<h2>
I Got Wood
</h2>

<p>"Freeeeeeedooooooom!" yelled Nick, doing his best Mel Gibson in <em>Braveheart</em> impression. He raised his beer then shotgunned it. Nick was drunk. He was pretty happy about it.</p>
<p>"Freeeeeeedooooooom!" yelled Ted and the guys doing their best Mel Gibson in <em>Braveheart</em> impressions. They raised their beers then shotgunned them. They were drunk. They were pretty happy about it.</p>
<p>Ted and the rest of the gang had dubbed themselves the Dirty Dozen for this long weekend on the Oregon Coast. Their mission? Keep Nick as drunk and happy as possible while celebrating the finalization of his divorce from his wife of four and a half months.</p>
<p>"I love you guys," said Nick, deep into the lovey drunk portion of the evening.</p>
<p>"And we love you!" they shouted back.</p>
<p>"What would I do without you?"</p>
<p>"Die!"</p>
<p>It was 11pm and they had a bonfire raging at the Canyon Drive Beach Access (#46) in Lincoln City, Oregon. The sky was clear and the stars were bright. Lights from the commercial fishing vessels dotted the horizon. The ocean was in front of them and the hundred foot grass and sand bluffs were behind them. A bracing 18mph wind from the North had miles of empty beach to do a run up and made the bonfire dance.</p>
<p>"Nick! Wood!"</p>
<p>"Aye aye, sirs!" said Nick, nearly completely failing at his attempt to stand up and absolutely completely failing at his attempt to salute. He had insisted on bringing the wood for the bonfire. He had also insisted on wearing his I Got Wood tee because, well, he was the guy who had brought the wood to the bonfire.</p>
<p>The Dirty Dozen began chanting, "I Got Wood!" as Nick stumbled his way to where his wood pile was supposed to be.</p>
<p>There was no wood. He looked around confused, then turned to the fellas, "No wood?"</p>
<p>The Dirty Dozen went silent for the first time that night, then a lone voice began chanting, "No wood!" and soon the rest took up the cause.</p>
<p>They rose from their folding seats and driftwood logs.</p>
<p>"No Wood! No wood!"</p>
<p>They started dancing around the fire.</p>
<p>"No wood! No wood!"</p>
<p>They formed a conga line. Someone began chanting, "Get wood!" The conga line shuffle step/kicked its way to the parking lot. Cars were started. The search was on. Muffled "Get wood!" cries were heard through acoustic auto glass all up and down Hwy 101. Thirty minutes later, failing to find firewood for sale anywhere in Lincoln City at midnight on a Sunday, they headed back to their beachfront vacation rental.</p>
<p>The Dirty Dozen climbed out of their cars, took off their shoes, and, at 12:30 in the morning, began clapping two dozen pairs of shoes against each other, the house rental, and the driveway in an attempt to get the sand out.  After a few minutes of futile and loudly echoing thwacking, and at the vigorous behest of some of their temporarily awake neighbors, they decided to concede defeat in their quest of drunken, early morning shoe de-sanding and left them outside for the night.</p>
<p>Also left outside for the night? Nick, who had begun the sleepy drunk portion of the evening when the conga line began. He'd fallen asleep on a driftwood tree trunk by the bonfire. "Get wood," he mumbled between snores. "Get wood."</p>
<p>- - -</p>
<p>Nick tried very hard to wake up as little as possible when he felt the ground move beneath him. Earthquake, he thought before falling back asleep. When the ground moved beneath him again, he got annoyed. "Darla, make it stop," he whined, forgetting that he was no longer married to Darla, and that she did not, in fact, have a super power that gave her control over earthquakes.</p>
<p>Nor, given the acrimony of the divorce, would she if she could.</p>
<p>Nick rolled over and fell into something cold and wet. The good news was that falling into the ocean surf was a surprisingly wonderful way to clear a sleepy, hungover head. The bad news, of course, was that your surroundings were the fifty degree waters of the Pacific Ocean on the Oregon Coast at three in the morning.</p>
<p>"Shit." He started.</p>
<p>"Shit." He continued.</p>
<p>"Shit." He concluded.</p>
<p>He was dragged down the beach as the seawater around him raced back toward the ocean. He dug his hands into the sand, but it didn't help much. When he hit the surf coming the other way he screamed in surprise at the cold, which he regretted almost immediately as ocean water and sand flooded his mouth. The water underneath him shifted back up the beach, and, coughing and sputtering, he managed to drag himself a couple of feet toward the dead bonfire before his comfy sleep driftwood tree trunk – all three tons of it - was pushed up over his right foot, up his right leg, and onto his lower back, pinning him face down in the sand. Water swirled around him. He panicked, trying to remember if it was three inches or six inches of water that a person could drown in. Nick was just able to arch his back enough to keep his head above it all, but no matter how hard he tried, he could not move himself out from under the driftwood.</p>
<p>As the water flowed toward the ocean again, the tree trunk was pulled down over his right leg and he felt the horrible popping of his right knee dislocating. Before he could think not to, he cried out and immediately choked on seawater and sand again.</p>
<p><em>This is so fucking stupid</em>, he thought to himself as he gagged. <em>I'm getting beat up by water and sand!</em></p>
<p>The surf calmed. He braced himself, waiting for the next wave to hit him, but none came. <em>Oh thank God</em>, he thought. He tried pushing off with his right leg, but only got bright lightning bolts of pain shooting all over his body from his knee for his efforts. <em>Check</em>, he thought after the pain dialed down to a 9 on the doctor office smiley card pain scale. <em>Don't push off with right leg.</em> He took a moment to gather his strength then began slowly crawling up the beach, making sure to use only his arms and his left leg.</p>
<p>A wave sideswiped him. He was pushed twenty feet to his right, dragged over and crushed against basalt rock laid bare by the ever-shifting sands. His skin was scraped raw. He bled from dozens of wounds. The water receded. He tried dragging himself away from the ocean, but couldn't bear the pain of dragging himself over the volcanic rock.</p>
<p>Another wave came, this one straight up the beach. It lifted him over the rock and onto sand. He managed to turn himself over onto his back, though the lower part of his injured leg remained bent the wrong way at a ninety degree angle. The seawater flowed back down the beach, his injured leg went with the flow and was pulled toward the ocean, it just kind of waved back and forth as the surf rushed around it. Luckily the surf left the rest of him where he was. Except for the terrible chorus of pain from the stinging of seawater on his wounds, and the electric pain of his dislocated knee, he was completely numb with cold. He shivered violently.</p>
<p>Nick saw a wave heading toward him. He tried using its momentum to move further up the beach, but the water brought the driftwood with it. It floated up over his legs, bending the injured one back onto itself, then landed on his chest, pinning him where he lay. The weight of it on his chest was suffocating. Water rushed around him. It lifted the tree trunk just enough for him to breathe, but then the water went over his head and he began drowning. The water receded down the beach, leaving the full weight of the driftwood on his chest and he began suffocating once again.</p>
<p>The cycle continued over and over: the weight of the tree trunk suffocated him, then the depth of the surf drowned him, he had only a few brief seconds between each interval to try and breathe. When he was suffocating all he could think to do was try to push the driftwood off. When he was drowning all he could think to do was get his head above water.</p>
<p>Drown.</p>
<p>Suffocate.</p>
<p>Drown.</p>
<p>Suffocate.</p>
<p>Drown.</p>
<p>Suffocate.</p>
<p>With each cycle his strength decreased. With each cycle his terror increased. He eventually stopped shivering. He eventually began convulsing. He eventually stopped breathing.</p>
<p>It took Nick seventeen minutes to die.</p>
<p>- - -</p>
<p>The Dirty Dozen woke up to someone pounding on the glass door of the back deck. The one overlooking the ocean.</p>
<p>"Go away!" Ted tried to yell, but all that came out was an enormous belch. He immediately scrunched his nose and waved his hand in front of his face. "Oh god, that's horrible. Smells like something died."</p>
<p>"I can smell it all the way over here," said one of the Dirty Dozen.</p>
<p>"Nocturnal emanation most foul," said another.</p>
<p>"Totally," someone else chimed in. "What'd you have for dinner? Roast skunk?"</p>
<p>"I drank my dinner," replied Ted. Then to the person outside, "Stop pounding on the door!"</p>
<p>The pounding stopped.</p>
<p>Ted couldn't see much on the balcony, it was too dark. A thick, swiftly moving fog blotted out the moon and the stars.</p>
<p>Ted saw the shadow of the person outside shift to his left, then a giant driftwood tree trunk came hurtling through the glass door, shattering it and the neighboring windows. The stench of death hit like a tsunami. The Dirty Dozen froze in place.</p>
<p>The person stepped into the vacation rental. They dragged their right leg. They wore a torn, soaked through tee with I Got Wood printed on it.</p>
<p>"What would I do without you guys?" Nick gargled.</p>

<h2>
Stave III<br />The Second of the Three Spirits
</h2>

<p>Scrooge woke up screaming, then realized his throat was rather sore so he stopped, for now, given the night he was having, though, he reserved the right to begin screaming again at a moment's notice. Oddly enough, Scrooge thought he still heard screaming. He took a moment to make sure it wasn't him; took another moment to ascertain that he was, indeed, back in his chambers, then got up to follow the sound of the screaming.</p>
<p>The screaming was rather loud and seemed to be coming from behind his closet door.</p>
<p>"This is my house," said Scrooge walking toward the door. "Whoever or whatever foul thing is in my closet, prepare to- "</p>
<p>As Scrooge laid his hand on the doorknob in mid-bluff, a strange voice called him by his name, and bade him enter. Since the screaming had stopped, Scrooge complied.</p>
<p>It was his own bedroom. There was no doubt about that. But it had undergone a surprising transformation. The closet was gone and the colors of his admittedly drab bedchamber were turned up to eleven. It was as if someone had taken a living picture and cranked up the HDR to worrying levels.</p>
<p>Scrooge looked behind him and saw his colorless bedroom, then looked back toward the closet and saw the bright, gleaming, over-saturated bedroom; and how he hadn't noticed before he couldn't say, but on his bed lay the biggest man Scrooge had ever laid eyes on. He had to be twelve feet tall and weight at least several hundred pounds more than Scrooge himself.</p>
<p>The creature lying on Scrooge's bed opened his mouth and screamed. Scrooge covered his ears and was about to run when the giant began laughing. It was a warm, inviting laugh. A laugh that did not make you the butt of a cruel joke but instead invited you to appreciate a clever joke well told. When the giant laughed a feast appeared around him: turkeys, hams, and chickens of all sizes; sausages, hot dogs, and brats prepared on a grill; chestnuts, strawberries, and apples looking freshly picked; butter cream, carrot, and red velvet cakes frosted to the nines; barrels of ale, casks of wine, and more juices than Scrooge could name. </p>
<p>"Waking up with a scream," exclaimed the giant. "How invigorating!"</p>
<p>Despite the giant's booming voice, Scrooge barely heard the giant speak. The giant, used to such behavior, clapped once, a loud, thunderous sound that would have gotten Scrooge's attention from even miles away. Scrooge focused on the giant in front of him.</p>
<p>"Come in!" exclaimed the giant. "Come in and know me better, man!"</p>
<p>Scrooge entered with his dander up. In his mind, one did not simply offer a spread such as the one laid out before him without wanting something in return. While any passerby would have described the giant's eyes as clear and kind, Scrooge's first thought when seeing the giant was 'used car salesman.'</p>
<p>The giant, as if reading Scrooge's mind, said, "I am the Ghost of Christmas Present. Look upon me!"</p>
<p>Scrooge did so, and seeing the loosely hung robe in shimmering emerald green, Croc'd feet, long curly hair, sparkling eye, cheery voice, and large suspect cigar held in one extra-large hand, Scrooge revised his initial impression and thought, 'trust fund frat bro.'</p>
<p>"You have never seen the like of me before!" exclaimed the Spirit.</p>
<p>"Every time I step foot on a used car lot or walk past fraternity row at the U," Scrooge made answer to it. "Spirit! Conduct me where you will and let us get this over with."</p>
<p>The Ghost of Christmas Present rose.</p>
<p>"Touch my robe!"</p>
<p>"Not a chance," replied Scrooge.</p>
<p>"Very well then. Grab an apple and we shall be off."</p>
<p>Scrooge did as he was told and held it fast.</p>
<p>His bed chamber, along with all the food and drink, save the apple in his hand, vanished instantly. They stood in a city street, snow falling pleasantly around them, yet Scrooge felt neither wind nor cold. It was evening and the neighborhood was full of children building snow forts and snow men while the sound of snow blowers and scraping shovels filled the air. Across the way in an open lot, defenders were preparing a snowball arsenal in a snow fort while attackers at the other end of the lot prepared their offensive ammunition. Christmas lights on houses, garages, trees, bushes, and lampposts blinked merrily. </p>
<p>"To be blunt," Scrooge said, ignoring the activity around him, instead staring pointedly at the cigar held in the giant's hand, "that is a peculiar smell coming from your cigar."</p>
<p>"Mind it not, Scrooge. Follow."</p>
<p>And perhaps it was the pleasure the good Spirit had in showing off this power of his, or else it was his own kind, generous, hearty nature, and his sympathy with all poor men, that led him straight to Scrooge's clerk's; for there he went, and took Scrooge with him, holding his apple; and on the threshold of the door the Spirit smiled, and stopped to bless Bob Cratchit’s dwelling with the smoke from his cigar.</p>
<p>The Spirit entered the house and Scrooge followed. They came upon the Cratchit family dining upon their Christmas Eve dinner. It was a humble spread but one well made. </p>
<p>The children, three girls and two boys, all heartily enjoying their Christmas Eve supper, were engrossed in their own discussions. Bob Cratchit leaned over to his wife and whispered, "The doctor said Tiny Tim isn't responding to the new medication. It looks like she'll try to enroll him in the study at the U she told us about."</p>
<p>They turned to look at their son, Tiny Tim, who, despite eating well, for they always made sure he had enough to eat so he could keep his strength up for the various procedures he endured, looked frail and small. Tiny Tim, though, as always, was putting up a brave front for his family.</p>
<p>"Will we be able to afford it?" said Mrs. Cratchit. "The doctor said it would be so expensive."</p>
<p>"We always find a way, dear," said Bob, grabbing his wife's hand.</p>
<p>Tiny Tim turned toward the two of them and smiled, having overheard their exchange, then turned back to his siblings, who were now arguing over who would have to clear the table.</p>
<p>"I'll do it," said Tiny Tim.</p>
<p>"You will not!" said Mrs. Cratchit. "You can barely walk with your crutches now. Come, children, let's start cleaning up. Bob, you take Tiny Tim over by the fire so he can warm himself."</p>
<p>With half-hearted groans, the children began clearing the table while Bob and Tiny Tim settled by the fire.</p>
<p>"Why do you always volunteer to do everything?" said Bob to his son, stroking his hair with worry.</p>
<p>"Dad, I believe we are here for each other. I want to help others and experience as much as I can while I can. God bless us, every one."</p>
<p>Bob gave his son a big hug and grabbed the book they had been reading together from the coffee table. They both faced the fire, then Bob started reading to Tiny Tim.</p>
<p>The Spirit turned toward Scrooge, "I see Bob reading alone by the fire, and crutches without an owner, if these shadows remain unaltered by the Future, the child will die."</p>
<p>Scrooge looked surprised. "Why tell me, Spirit? You cannot believe this is my fault? It looks as though I pay Bob enough to have a Christmas Eve dinner and to afford medical care for Tiny Tim. Surely you cannot ask any more from me?"</p>
<p>The Spirit, usually carefree and relaxed, looked disgustedly at Scrooge, "The meal was provided by the local food bank and their medical coverage is provided by MinnesotaCare."</p>
<p>"Then Bob should find a job that pays better!" said Scrooge. "It's a free market. He doesn't have to work for me. He should just find another job. It's simple self-interest and self-responsibility."</p>
<p>"Tiny Tim will die."</p>
<p>"Then let the God that Tiny Tim believes in save him! Your God is all-powerful, right? Let your all-powerful, all-knowing God do something for him."</p>
<p>Mrs. Cratchit and the other children finished in the kitchen and brought cups and Kemp's eggnog with them as they sat around the fire. </p>
<p>"A toast," said Bob. "Good will toward all!"</p>
<p>They raised their glasses and drank to the good of all mankind.</p>
<p>"Bah humbug!" said Scrooge. "They could all be out working this evening, shoveling sidewalks or plowing parking lots, instead of living off the charity of others. And look, over there, all those presents under the Christmas tree, probably provided by kindhearted fools who grabbed the children's names off an Angel Tree in Target or CVS."</p>
<p>Scrooge walked away from the warmth, light, and love of the house into the cold, dark night. "Take me back home, Spirit."</p>
<p>The giant turned to watch Scrooge leave and said, "You must first look at the apple in your hand."</p>
<p>Scrooge did as he was asked. The apple was shriveled and bruised. </p>
<p>"That is an apple from the tree of knowledge," said the Ghost. "It reflects in itself the knowledge and wisdom of the one who holds it."</p>
<p>As Scrooge watched the apple, it turned black, then to dust. </p>
<p>The Ghost appeared beside Scrooge.</p>
<p>"Without that apple," said the Spirit, "you are lost and have no way of getting home. I'm afraid I must leave you now."</p>
<p>Scrooge was about to protest but the Spirit disappeared into the falling snow which began to rage around them. Scrooge tried in vain to see Cratchit's house or any of the Christmas decorations lit nearby, but to no avail. Scrooge thrust his arms out in front of him and walked, hoping he was headed toward shelter; but hope soon turned to panic and, as the snow swirled wildly, stinging his face and hands, choking him when he breathed, Scrooge ran blindly. He made it only a couple of steps when he hit a tree, banging his head, knocking himself out.</p>

<a class="titolo" id="stave.four"></a>
<h2>
Stave IV<br />The Last of the Spirits
</h2>

<p>Scrooge could have sworn he was awake. He thought his eyes were open. He raised his hands and felt his eyes to be open. He could blink. No matter what he did, though, he could see only blackness.  He looked all round himself, trying to find any light, or any thing, to focus on; slowly, out of the corner of his eye, he saw an even deeper blackness coalesce into a hooded form. The darkness of the hooded form made the previous blackness seem like a sunny day at high noon.</p>
<p>Scrooge had had enough. "Let me guess," he said. "You're the Ghost of Things Yet To Come."</p>
<p>The spirit answered not, but pointed with its hand.</p>
<p>Although well used to ghostly company by this time, Scrooge raged at the silent shape so much that his legs trembled before him, and he found that he could hardly stand.</p>
<p>"I don't care to go anywhere with you or see anything you have to offer, Spirit!" spat Scrooge. "I do not fear you, I only fear the time of mine you are sure to waste. You believe your purpose here is to do me good? The best good you could do me is to stop causing me concussions and letting me get a good night's sleep!"</p>
<p>The Spirit waved its arm at Scrooge and he saw a street scene. It was deathly cold out and a light snow was falling from a heavy sky. Two men were walking toward a bar when a street urchin ran toward them begging for money.</p>
<p>"Go away kid, ya bother me," said the first man.</p>
<p>"Oh, come on, Bill," said the second, grabbing his wallet and handing over a fiver. "Don't be such a Scrooge."</p>
<p>"Spirit!" said Scrooge, ignoring the rest of the scene. "I do not care what my legacy is, but if 'being a Scrooge' means not giving money to people who didn't earn it, than I, for one. am proud!"</p>
<p>The Spirit again waved its arm at Scrooge and the street scene changed to a hospital room. The room was crowded as two adults and four children stood vigil around a bed where a small child was hooked up to a heart monitor that had just gone from beeping to flat line.</p>
<p>"Tiny Tim!" screamed Mrs. Cratchit, squeezing her boy's hand.</p>
<p>Bob Cratchit silently cried and Tiny Tim's siblings held each other tightly.</p>
<p>Scrooge got a closer look at Tiny Tim and saw he was no older than when he had seen him at the Cratchit's house earlier in the evening.</p>
<p>"What of it?" said Scrooge to the Spirit. "Tiny Tim was getting the best medical care his family could afford. Of course the family is sad, but they'll get over it. People die all the time."</p>
<p>At this, the Spirit waved its arm at Scrooge yet again and the hospital room faded away as Scrooge's bed chamber came into focus.</p>
<p>"Finally!" said Scrooge. "Finally one of you Spectres takes me home!"</p>
<p>Scrooge was so pleased to be home, and so tired from his ghostly travels, that he jumped directly into bed without first changing his clothes or pulling back any of the bed curtains. The briefest moment later he jumped right back out so violently that he caused the bed curtains to fall from their poles before running up to the cloaked Spirit.</p>
<p>"How dare you!" said Scrooge, shaking his finger under the Spectre's hood. "How dare you!"</p>
<p>With the bed curtains fallen away, one could see Ebeneezer lying in bed alone, white as a, well, ghost. If one looked carefully at his chest they would discern neither rise nor fall of whatsoever.</p>
<p>"My own death doesn't scare me, Spirit, despite the surprise of coming upon my own corpse in the bed I was ready to sleep in. Your cheap parlor tricks mean nothing. I care not what happens to me after I die for I will no longer be conscious to worry about it, and, before you try to show me what happens to all of my money, know that I care not about that either after I am dead. Money is simply a way to keep score while I am alive; when I am dead let my money go where it may! And before you take me to my graveside service where, I am absolutely sure, there are no mourners, know that I care not about that either! Now take me home!"</p>
<p>After the briefest of hesitations, the Spirit waved its hand at Scrooge a final time. The Spirit seemed to collapse into itself, then disappeared entirely.</p>

<h2>
Stave V<br />The End Of It
</h2>

<p>There was no blow to the head. There was no slipping into unconsciousness. Scrooge blinked and the bed curtains were back in place. He edged to the side of the bed and tentatively pulled back the bed curtain with one finger. </p>
<p>Yes! The bed was his own. The room was his own. Best and happiest of all, the Time before him was his own.</p>
<p>"Thank God!" said Scrooge, then chuckled at what he'd said.</p>
<p>Scrooge took a long hot shower, got himself a nice hot meal, then collapsed into bed and slept all through Christmas and into the next day.</p>
<p>When he awoke bright and early on December the 26th, he immediately opened his window to let in some fresh air. Scrooge breathed deeply, enjoying the cold air washing across his face for a long moment, then looked up into the bright blue sky which was, he noted, gloriously free of be-chained spirits wailing and lamenting the difficulties of others' victimhood.</p>
<p>"Bah! Humbug!" said Scrooge, closing the window then making ready to go to his counting house.</p>
<p>Those who saw Scrooge walking to work that day saw a man renewed; a man with a spring in his step; a man who had glimpsed the tragic comedy of the Heavens themselves and turned away in the knowledge that he was better. To Scrooge's way of thinking, he wasn't sure whether or not any of it had happened, but he was sure it didn't matter; all that mattered was that he lived his life by his Principles of Reason, the very same Principles that allowed him to win at life every day of the year.</p>
<p>When Scrooge got to his counting house, he decided to not start a fire, instead finding pen and paper; what he wrote was simple: Help Wanted, Clerk.</p>
<p>Scrooge sat patiently then, watching his pocket watch as it moved from nine o'clock to nine oh five to nine fifteen. When his watch read nine twenty-three he heard the bell above the door ding and the stomping of feet. Bob Cratchit came into view looking sheepish and worried. </p>
<p>"Running late, Mr. Cratchit?" said Scrooge,  the smallest of smiles touching his lips.</p>
<p>"Sorry, sir. Indeed, sir. I was up late with the family telling Christmas Tales and drinking eggnog by the fire."</p>
<p>"Put this piece of paper in the window," said Scrooge, handing over the 'Help Wanted' sign.</p>
<p>The clerk put the sign in the window then turned to Scrooge.</p>
<p>"You're fired, Mr. Cratchit." said Scrooge, picking up a pen and starting in on the ledgers in front of him; the end of the fiscal year was always busy, so many peoples' money problems became even more problematic during the Holiday Season. He had many properties to foreclose on. "You came in late today despite your promise to come in early."</p>
<p>Bob Cratchit lowered his head and opened the door to leave.</p>
<p>"Oh, Cratchit," said Scrooge, closing the ledger in front of him and looking down his nose at his ex-clerk. "In lieu of two weeks notice and pay, please accept my best wishes for your boy, Tiny Tim."</p>
<p>As Cratchit left the office, Scrooge grabbed another ledger to work on from the very large pile on his desk. He had no further intercourse with Spirits, and had learned to keep Christmas in his heart, in his own way, ever after.</p>
