<p>Jim stopped the truck where the forest road ended and the hiking trail started. There was a small, hand painted sign that read: Trail Head.</p>
<p>"I have got to get a picture of that!" said Ryan. He grabbed his phone, hopped out of the truck, and took a couple pics.</p>
<p>"You've had to 'get a picture of that' for just about everything so far," said Jim, smiling as he turned the ignition off and got out.</p>
<p>They went to the back of the truck to grab their gear.</p>
<p>"I've been looking forward to this for years!" said Ryan. "Years! Come on! Open up! Open up!"</p>
<p>"You're practically vibrating," Jim replied, going through his jumble of keys. He eventually found the right one, unlocked the truck topper, and opened the tailgate.</p>
<p>"So exciting!" Ryan shouted. He snatched his backpack from the truck and got it on in record time. He looked at Jim and smiled. "Oregon! Woo!"</p>
<p>Jim looked sidelong at his new friend while grabbing the extra water. "You do have forests in Wisconsin."</p>
<p>"Yeah, but not like this!" Ryan gripped his backpack's straps, sighed, and looked up. It was a beautiful summer day in the Coastal range. The deep blue sky was framed by towering Sitka spruce whose trunks were swallowed by the ferns mobbing the forest floor. There wasn't a level piece of ground in sight. A cool breeze blew off the Pacific. "I can't believe its freakin' August! Do you know what the temp and humidity are in Wisconsin right now? 95!"</p>
<p>"Is that the temp or the humidity?" asked Jim.</p>
<p>"Both!"</p>
<p>"That," Jim said, grabbing his backpack and buckling it on, "truly sucks."</p>
<p>"It's reason number three hundred twenty seven why I wanted to move out here."</p>
<p>"Well," Jim said, grabbing a fanny pack and slamming the tailgate shut, "now that you're finally out here, let's get going on your first PNW hike." He clipped the fanny pack around his waist, shrugged his backpack a couple of times to get it seated properly, then gestured for Ryan to lead the way.</p>
<p>The two of them spent the next couple hours hiking – gaining and losing hundreds upon hundreds of feet of elevation. </p>
<p>"The views! The drop-offs!" said Ryan for the hundredth time that day.  The-"</p>
<p>"-water breaks," finished Jim. He stopped, shrugged off his pack, grabbed two waters, and handed one to Ryan.</p>
<p>"Stupid beautiful," said Ryan, drinking. He wiped some sweat off his brow with his tee. "This is all just so stupid beautiful."</p>
<p>They found places to sit and drink their water while they enjoyed the quiet psithurism of the wind blowing through the trees and the burble of the water flowing around rocks in the nearby creek.</p>
<p>After a bit, they got up and brushed themselves off. Ryan tossed his empty water bottle to Jim, who utterly and completely failed to catch it.</p>
<p>"Dude," said Ryan walking toward him, picking up the water bottle. "Fast hands." He tried to hand it to him, but Jim's hand wouldn't close around the bottle. Ryan looked at him more closely, all the blood had drained from Jim's face and he was trembling ever so slightly. "Jim? Hey Jim!" He waved his hands in front of Jim's face. "Earth to Jim!" He snapped his fingers.</p>
<p>Jim grabbed Ryan's hands so quickly he didn't see them move.</p>
<p>"Shh...shsshshhhh...shh...shsh," Jim managed through gritted teeth. </p>
<p>Ryan tried to catch Jim's eye. "Hey! Hey! What's wrong? Do you have a medical cond-"</p>
<p>Jim let go of Ryan's hands and grabbed his shoulders - he felt like he was being gripped by two overly-tightened vices – then spun him around.</p>
<p>Ryan got as far as,"Come on, man! What's going o-,"  before he saw the mama bear and two cubs thirty feet away from them, stopped on the trail where Ryan and Jim had just come from.</p>
<p>The bears were staring at them.</p>
<p>"Shit!" Whispered Ryan.</p>
<p>"Yes," Jim whispered back. "Shit."</p>
<p>"What are we gonna do, man?"</p>
<p>"Don't make any sudden moves. You'll startle them. Don't run. Their prey drive will kick in and they can run faster than Usain Bolt. You cannot outrun them. Don't try to climb a tree. They can climb trees almost as fast as they can run."</p>
<p>"Jesus Christ! Then what the hell are we supposed to do."</p>
<p>"Don't worry. I brought a...deterrent."</p>
<p>The bear cubs were getting curious and started toward the two hikers. Momma bear was decidedly unhappy with this turn of events and began huffing. </p>
<p>"Okay. I'm gonna grab something from my fanny pack, then we have to rush toward the bears making ourselves as big as we can while yelling at the top of our lungs."</p>
<p>"That," said Ryan, "does not sound like it should be Plan A." He felt Jim remove his hands from his shoulders. He heard a zipper being opened slowly. He heard a snick followed by Jim mumbling something that sounded like, 'not again.' He heard another snick then risked a look back. Jim was holding a revolver.</p>
<p>"You're gonna shoot them?" asked Ryan. "You can't just shoot them!"</p>
<p>"I would never shoot a bear," responded Jim. "Besides, this is just a little .22. It'd just tick 'em off."</p>
<p>"So why-"</p>
<p>"Alright, on the count of three, we're gonna rush the bears."</p>
<p>"But-"</p>
<p>"One."</p>
<p>"Are you sure? This doesn't-"</p>
<p>"Two."</p>
<p>"I don't know if I can-"</p>
<p>"Remember. Make yourself big and loud."</p>
<p>"Okay," whimpered Ryan.</p>
<p>The cubs continued to slowly make their way toward the hikers. Momma bear started pounding her front paws on the ground and clacking her teeth between huffs.</p>
<p>"Three!" shouted Jim.</p>
<p>Ryan roared. He threw his arms out and flapped them like he was trying to fly. He hopped toward the bears and screamed, "Go away, bears! Go away, scary bears!"</p>
<p>The cubs ran back toward their mother. Momma bear's lower lip protruded and her ears flattened.</p>
<p>Ryan shouted. "I think it's working!" He glanced back at Jim, who was pointing the gun at his leg. Ryan stopped his flapping, hopping, yelling advance and, through his confusion, said, "Wha-?" </p>
<p>"That was really something," said Jim. His face broke into an agonized rictus. His eyes wide and unblinking. "I'm," his voice broke. "I'm so sorry," he whispered. He pulled the trigger.</p>
<p>Ryan heard a pop and felt a burning sting in his calf. He collapsed, grabbed his calf, and started screaming. </p>
<p>Momma bear charged.</p>
<p>Jim stood still for a moment and watched, then turned and ran for all he was worth. <em>Lucky for me,</em> he thought, <em>I don't have to outrun the bear.</em></p>
<p>Ryan felt an immense pressure, first on his back, then on his right shoulder. <em>Huh,</em> he thought, <em>just like having wisdom teeth pulled – all pressure, no pain.</em> He was violently jerked around then dropped. He felt lightheaded. Confused. He was annoyed by a high-pitched wailing, then astonished to discover he was the one making it. His vision blurred then cleared. He saw his arm lying on the trail a couple feet away. "That," he wheezed, spitting up foamy blood bubbles, "is not right." He wished for his vision to blur again. He felt more pressure on his back, then heard cracking and crunching. <em>Ah,</em> he thought while passing out, <em>there's the pain.</em></p>
<p>Momma bear sniffed around the unconscious Ryan then gathered up her cubs and headed down the trail the way they'd come. Ryan came to in time to see the bears round a bend in the trail and disappear from sight. <em>Who knew bear butts were furry?</em> he thought. <em>Furry bear butts! Furry bear butts!</em> Ryan started giggling, or at least he felt like giggling, but his crushed lungs would not allow him the breath to do it, so he just convulsed for a moment. <em>Furry bear butts!</em> He tried getting up but couldn't move his arm or his legs. <em>Can't move my other arm either!</em> he thought, which caused more convulsions. His vision started tunneling. He felt an infinitely increasing weariness and detachment. <em>Oregon. Woo,</em> he thought. </p>
<p>Ryan had one, final, overwhelming urge to live. All people from Wisconsin experience it when they're about to die. <em>I'm never gonna eat cheese again,</em> he thought. His body and mind rebelled at such a horrible and alien concept, but alas, not even the power of cheese was enough to save him.</p>

<h2>
I Got Wood
</h2>

<p>"Freeeeeeedooooooom!" yelled Nick, doing his best Mel Gibson in <em>Braveheart</em> impression. He raised his beer then shotgunned it. Nick was drunk. He was pretty happy about it.</p>
<p>"Freeeeeeedooooooom!" yelled Ted and the guys doing their best Mel Gibson in <em>Braveheart</em> impressions. They raised their beers then shotgunned them. They were drunk. They were pretty happy about it.</p>
<p>Ted and the rest of the gang had dubbed themselves the Dirty Dozen for this long weekend on the Oregon Coast. Their mission? Keep Nick as drunk and happy as possible while celebrating the finalization of his divorce from his wife of four and a half months.</p>
<p>"I love you guys," said Nick, deep into the lovey drunk portion of the evening.</p>
<p>"And we love you!" they shouted back.</p>
<p>"What would I do without you?"</p>
<p>"Die!"</p>
<p>It was 11pm and they had a bonfire raging at the Canyon Drive Beach Access (#46) in Lincoln City, Oregon. The sky was clear and the stars were bright. Lights from the commercial fishing vessels dotted the horizon. The ocean was in front of them and the hundred foot high grass and sand bluffs were behind them. A bracing 18mph wind from the North had miles of empty beach to do a run up and made the bonfire dance.</p>
<p>"Nick! Wood!"</p>
<p>"Aye aye, sirs!" said Nick, nearly completely failing at his attempt to stand up and absolutely completely failing at his attempt to salute. He had insisted on bringing the wood for the bonfire. He had also insisted on wearing his I Got Wood tee because, well, he was the guy who had brought the wood to the bonfire.</p>
<p>The Dirty Dozen began chanting, "I Got Wood!" as Nick stumbled his way to where his wood pile was supposed to be.</p>
<p>There was no wood. He looked around confused, then turned to the fellas, "No wood?"</p>
<p>The Dirty Dozen went silent for the first time that night, then a lone voice began chanting, "No wood!" and soon the rest took up the cause.</p>
<p>They rose from their folding seats and driftwood logs.</p>
<p>"No Wood! No wood!"</p>
<p>They started dancing around the fire.</p>
<p>"No wood! No wood!"</p>
<p>They formed a conga line. Someone began chanting, "Get wood!" The conga line shuffle step/kicked its way to the parking lot. Cars were started. The search was on. Muffled "Get wood!" cries were heard through acoustic auto glass all up and down Hwy 101. Thirty minutes later, failing to find firewood for sale anywhere in Lincoln City at midnight on a Sunday, they headed back to their beachfront vacation rental.</p>
<p>The Dirty Dozen climbed out of their cars, took off their shoes, and, at 12:30 in the morning, began clapping two dozen pairs of shoes against each other, the house rental, and the driveway in an attempt to get the sand out.  After a few minutes of futile and loudly echoing thwacking, and at the vigorous behest of some of their temporarily awake neighbors, they decided to concede defeat in their quest of drunken, early morning shoe de-sanding and left them outside for the night.</p>
<p>Also left outside for the night? Nick, who had begun the sleepy drunk portion of the evening when the conga line began. He'd fallen asleep on a driftwood tree trunk by the bonfire. "Get wood," he mumbled between snores. "Get wood."</p>
<p>- - -</p>
<p>Nick tried very hard to wake up as little as possible when he felt the ground move beneath him. Earthquake, he thought before falling back asleep. When the ground moved beneath him again, he got annoyed. "Darla, make it stop," he whined, forgetting that he was no longer married to Darla, and that she did not, in fact, have a super power that gave her control over earthquakes.</p>
<p>Nor, given the acrimony of the divorce, would she if she could.</p>
<p>Nick rolled over and fell into something cold and wet. The good news was that falling into the ocean surf was a surprisingly wonderful way to clear a sleepy, hungover head. The bad news, of course, was that your surroundings were the fifty degree waters of the Pacific Ocean on the Oregon Coast at three in the morning.</p>
<p>"Shit." He started.</p>
<p>"Shit." He continued.</p>
<p>"Shit." He concluded.</p>
<p>He was dragged down the beach as the seawater around him raced back toward the ocean. He dug his hands into the sand, but it didn't help much. When he hit the surf coming the other way he screamed in surprise at the cold, which he regretted almost immediately as ocean water and sand flooded his mouth. The water underneath him shifted back up the beach, and, coughing and sputtering, he managed to drag himself a couple of feet toward the dead bonfire before his comfy sleep driftwood tree trunk – all three tons of it - was pushed up over his right foot, up his right leg, and onto his lower back, pinning him face down in the sand. Water swirled around him. He panicked, trying to remember if it was three inches or six inches of water that a person could drown in. Nick was just able to arch his back enough to keep his head above it all, but no matter how hard he tried, he could not move himself out from under the driftwood.</p>
<p>As the water flowed toward the ocean again, the tree trunk was pulled down over his right leg and he felt the horrible popping of his right knee dislocating. Before he could think not to, he cried out and immediately choked on seawater and sand again.</p>
<p><em>This is so fucking stupid</em>, he thought to himself as he gagged. <em>I'm getting my ass handed to me by water and sand!</em></p>
<p>The surf calmed. He braced himself, waiting for the next wave to hit him, but none came. <em>Oh thank God</em>, he thought. He tried pushing off with his right leg, but only got bright lightning bolts of pain shooting all over his body from his knee for his efforts. <em>Check</em>, he thought after the pain dialed down to a 9 on the doctor office smiley card pain scale. <em>Don't push off with right leg.</em> He took a moment to gather his strength then began slowly crawling up the beach, making sure to use only his arms and his left leg.</p>
<p>A wave sideswiped him. He was pushed twenty feet to his right, dragged over and crushed against basalt rock laid bare by the ever-shifting sands. His skin was scraped raw. He bled from dozens of wounds. The water receded. He tried crawling away from the ocean, but couldn't bear the pain of dragging himself over the volcanic rock.</p>
<p>Another wave came, this one straight up the beach. It lifted him over the rock and onto sand. He managed to turn himself over onto his back, though the lower part of his injured leg remained bent the wrong way at a ninety degree angle. The seawater flowed back down the beach, his injured leg went with the flow and was pulled toward the ocean, it just kind of waved back and forth as the surf rushed around it. Luckily the surf left the rest of him where he was. Except for the terrible chorus of pain from the stinging of seawater on his wounds, and the electric pain of his dislocated knee, he was completely numb with cold. He shivered violently.</p>
<p>Nick saw a wave heading toward him. He tried using its momentum to move further up the beach, but the water brought the driftwood with it. It floated up over his legs, bending the injured one back onto itself, then landed on his chest, pinning him where he lay. The weight of it was suffocating. Water rushed around him. It lifted the tree trunk just enough for him to breathe, but then the water went over his head and he began drowning. The water receded down the beach, leaving the full weight of the driftwood on his chest and he began suffocating once again.</p>
<p>The cycle continued over and again: the weight of the tree trunk suffocated him, then the depth of the surf drowned him, he had only a few brief seconds between each interval to try and breathe. When he was suffocating all he could think to do was try to push the driftwood off. When he was drowning all he could think to do was get his head above water.</p>
<p>Drown.</p>
<p>Suffocate.</p>
<p>Drown.</p>
<p>Suffocate.</p>
<p>Drown.</p>
<p>Suffocate.</p>
<p>With each cycle his strength decreased. With each cycle his terror increased. He eventually stopped shivering. He eventually began convulsing. He eventually stopped breathing.</p>
<p>It took Nick seventeen minutes to die.</p>
<p>- - -</p>
<p>The Dirty Dozen woke up to someone pounding on the glass door of the back deck. The one overlooking the ocean.</p>
<p>"Go away!" Ted tried to yell, but all that came out was an enormous belch. He immediately scrunched his nose and waved his hand in front of his face. "Oh god, that's horrible. Smells like something died."</p>
<p>"I can smell it all the way over here," said one of the Dirty Dozen.</p>
<p>"Nocturnal emanation most foul," said another.</p>
<p>"Totally," someone else chimed in. "What'd you have for dinner? Smells like dead fish?"</p>
<p>"I drank my dinner," replied Ted. Then to the person outside, "Stop pounding on the door!"</p>
<p>The pounding stopped.</p>
<p>Ted couldn't see much on the balcony, it was too dark. A thick, swiftly moving fog blotted out the moon and the stars.</p>
<p>Ted saw the shadow of the person outside shift to his left, then a giant driftwood tree trunk came hurtling through the glass door, shattering it and the neighboring windows. The stench of death hit like a tsunami. The Dirty Dozen froze in place.</p>
<p>The person stepped into the vacation rental. They dragged their right leg. They wore a torn, soaked through tee with I Got Wood printed on it.</p>
<p>"What would I do without you guys?" Nick gargled.</p>

<a class="titolo" id="family.picnic"></a>
<h2>
Family Picnic
</h2>

<p>Belinda Jablonski had taken the kids – Pete, 12, and Kelsi, 13 – to the Family Picnic in Lake Tahoe. The Family Picnic was a seven day affair consisting of organized water sports, hiking, horseback riding, heli-biking, catered meals, and lodging at her parents' sprawling family compound.</p>
<p>The Family Picnic was most definitely spelled, and spoken, in the uppercase.</p>
<p>"Think you'll be able to rough it for a week?" Stephen Jablonski had asked while seeing them off bright and early at six in the morning.</p>
<p>"You'd love it there, you know. It's beautiful." replied Belinda, loading up the last of the luggage and ignoring the jab. "Besides, I worry about you all by yourself for a week." She walked over to her husband and gently touched his face.</p>
<p>"I know. I know. But those AP History papers won't grade themselves." He nodded toward the kids - phones on, earbuds in - in the second row seats. "Spring break for thee but not for me. And don't worry, I won't let anyone know that I, a grown man, was able to take care of myself for a whole week. Nobody wants that kind of information getting out to the general public."</p>
<p>Her gentle caress turned into a light slap of his shoulder. She put on her serious face. "You're going to go to the Family Picnic one day, and then you'll fully embrace the hoity toity." She laughed, then started breathing heavily as she raised her arm and made a fist, "If you only knew the power of the dark side."</p>
<p>"Nerd!"</p>
<p>"Pleb!"</p>
<p>They hugged. He opened the door for her and she hopped into the driver's seat of the Chevy Tahoe.</p>
<p>"I always forget how short you are until I see you climb into the Tahoe," Stephen said. Before she could respond he raised his voice to give himself a shot at being heard by the kids. "Take care of your mom. Have fun this week. Enjoy the Bohemian Grove! I love you!"</p>
<p>Without looking up from their phones, the kids gave the slightest of nods, which Stephen interpreted as, <em>Dearest father, we don't know what the Bohemian Grove is, but we love you, we'll miss you, we'll take care of mother, and we will, indeed, have a wonderful time at the Family Picnic.</em></p>
<p>Belinda made a dismissive gesture with her hand. "Bohemian Grove? Bohemian Grove wishes they could get into the Family Picnic." She cocked a thumb toward the kids behind her. "Next time, try livestreaming your goodbye to them on Twitch. I bet they'd love that." She closed the door, started the SUV, and powered the window down. "Oh yeah, I'm not going out 18, TripCheck says there's an accident. I'll head down to Newport then hop over the Coastal Range on 20."</p>
<p>Stephen gave her a thumbs up, blew her a kiss, then said, "Make sure to call when you get there." He waved as they pulled out of the driveway and down the street. When they were out of sight he headed in the house. "Okay!" he said, rubbing his hands together. "Back to bed. Wake up after noon. Burgers on the grill for lunch." </p>
<p>A man with a plan. </p>


<h5>Day One</h5>
<p>The Jablonski's house was situated on the cheap side of a street running parallel to, and 125 feet on a bluff above, the crashing waves of the Pacific Ocean. In contrast to the homes on the expensive side of the road - cedar shingled, 7000 square foot monstrosities perched on the edge of terra firma, hunched close together, bogarting the multi-million dollar views of the Pacific Ocean - the Jablonski's was a cozy affair painted cayenne orange with a lime green door. No view of the ocean, had the Jablonskis, unless they were on the second floor in their bedroom and the rich folks' blinds across the street happened to be open. The back of their property lie adjacent to a heavily wooded forest of shore pines which sloped sharply down to a stream which wound its way through the forest floor, eventually finding its way to the sea.</p> 
<p>Attached to the back of their house, overlooking the forested ravine, was a deck with a wooden bench, a wood slat table, and a Weber charcoal grill currently tended to by a very happy man.</p>
<p>Stephen whistled as he finished with the grill, threw the meat and buns on a paper plate – only paper plates this week, no washing dishes if he could help it – and sat down on the bench. Before him lay Lunch (he figured if Belinda's family was gonna capitalize the important things, so should he): burgers and buns on a plate, burger fixins on a second plate, beer in a mug kept in the freezer for special occasions (one of the few exceptions to the dish washing rule for the week), and an iPhone and earbuds for tunes.</p>
<p>Conspicuously absent from his set up? Napkins. Along with waking up late and the use of paper plates, <em>we don't need no stinking napkins,</em> was one of his mantras for the week.</p>
<p>It was a beautiful day on the Oregon Coast. 65 degrees and sunny. From his bench seat on the deck, Stephen saw bluebirds, robins, and western tanagers flitting from branch to branch; seagulls and birds of prey soaring high above, riding the thermals created where water met land; bees and butterflies working their way around the flower garden alongside rabbits and deer, which were completely unafraid of humans and totally enamored of the tender shoots and flowers of the garden Belinda assiduously minded. Stephen added the proper fixins in the proper proportions to his burger, grabbed it, and, with a sigh of contentment, simply sat for a moment in anticipation.</p>
<p>His phone buzzed. The FaceTime notification chimed loudly in his earbuds. Stephen jumped and dropped his burger on the table. The patty slid halfway through one of the gaps between slats and stuck there. He instinctively swiped Accept and left a greasy, meaty streak on his iPhone.</p>
<p>"Hi, Steve!" said Belinda.</p>
<p>Stephen froze. There was a lot to grok, a lot of mental gears to shift.</p>
<p>"Steve? Stephen? Are you there?"</p>
<p>"Ahhhhhh-," said Stephen. He finally kicked into gear, grabbed some lettuce, and tried to wipe off the mess on his screen. He only succeeded in spreading it around.</p>
<p>"Stephen? I can hear you but I'm only seeing a cloudy schmear."</p>
<p>"Yeah. Uhhhh." said Stephen. He wiped his hands on his shirt, grabbed his phone, then wiped that on his shirt as well. "Ahhhh...Hi! Hi! Just a minor lunch snafu. Hi! Uh...how's the trip?"</p>
<p>"There's your smiling face! Let me guess. You got startled, dropped everything, but are currently working under the no napkin mandate? You still using lettuce to clean or have you escalated to using your shirt?"</p>
<p>Stephen panned the phone down, showing the sorry state of his shirt.</p>
<p>Belinda giggled, "We stopped at Lake Alamor to stretch our legs and I thought I'd just give a ring. Love ya! Sorry for interrupting lunch. I'll let you get back to it."</p>
<p>"No worries. Glad y'all are good. I think I can save lunch."</p>
<p>"Steve, I have to ask. Will the no napkin mandate hold during this catastrophic incident?"</p>
<p>"Pshhhhhhh ... sorry ... pshhhhh ... house ... going through ... tunnel ... pshhhhhhhh ... love ... pshhhhhhhhhh ... bye."</p>
<p>Stephen heard laughter as she ended the call. </p>
<p>He looked at the mess around him and sighed. It was already getting harder for him to find a clean area on his shirt, but he found one and rubbed his iPhone screen on it again. He put down the phone then grabbed the hamburger patty from the gap in the table. <em>I wonder if I can salvage this,</em> he thought. He examined the patty. <em>Looks okay.</em> He put it down then peeked into the slat gap to see if there were any obvious obstacles to burger patty redemption. He saw some quarter inch sized lumps on the side of the slat. He moved closer and rubbed off some of the hamburger and grease that covered them.</p>
<p>"Mushrooms?" Stephen said. "Are you mushrooms?" He got closer. "What are you little fellas doing there?" He poked them a bit then his stomach rumbled.</p>
<p>"Back to business!" he exclaimed to the backyard.</p>
<p>Stephen put the slat patty back in the gap between the slats. "Good patty holder," he said, then prepared a second hamburger. He ate his hot burger, drank his cold beer, and lazed the afternoon away on the deck getting some sun and listening to classic rock. When he finally cleared the table – including the slat patty – he considered wiping it all down, then thought, <em>Nah, I'm outta lettuce.</em></p>


<h5>Day Two</h5>
<p>Stephen woke up after noon again. <em>Two for two,</em> he thought. <em>Excellent.</em> He took care of his <s>morning</s> afternoon ablutions, gathered up his cookout accouterments, and headed to the deck. He set everything down on the table and-</p>
<p>"Holy shit!"</p>
<p>There was a big stonkin' blood red mushroom growing between the slats. It was segmented with overlapping brackets, about two inches wide and eight inches long.</p>
<p>"What are you?" asked Stephen crawling under the table to get a better view of it. "You kinda look like chicken of the woods, but that color..." From this position he could see it was starting to expand to the slats next to it. "Totally awesome," he said, his 1980s showing. He poked it softly. It gave at first, then pushed back against his finger.</p> 
<p>"Woah."</p>
<p>He reached on top of the table and blindly felt for the cookout tongs. <em>Paper plate ... frosty mug ... fixins plate ...ah, there they were.</em> He poked the mushroom with the tongs. It exploded open, crimson red spores and an electric blue liquid ooze pulsed out of its bottom. He gasped, inhaling spores, then jerked his head back, bumping it on the underside of the table. He felt the bench with his tush, twisted around, planted his hands on it, and pushed up. He bumped the table hard with his back, turned around again, and sat heavily on the bench.</p>
<p>He laughed as he rubbed the back of his head where he'd bumped it. He looked at the table and saw that the top of the mushroom had exploded, as well. There was a giant cloud of red spores hovering over the entire deck.</p>
<p>He was breathing the spores in. He stopped laughing.</p>
<p>Movement caught his eye. He turned and saw the blue ooze, well, oozing its way toward the burgers and fixins which had shifted off the plates when he'd hit the table – twice - and fallen on the mushroom. It flowed around the lettuce, tomatoes, and onions - ignoring them - toward the burgers. The blue ooze seeped into the burgers and broke them down until there was nothing left.</p>
<p>"Whaaaat the fuuuuck."</p>
<p>Stephen sprinted into the house, up the stairs, and into the shower fully clothed. He ran the hot water as hot as he could stand it. He stripped off his clothes, and used an entire bar of soap and all the shampoo trying to get clean. He stayed in the shower until the hot water ran out, then stepped out, failed to towel off, and lumbered his way, naked, to bed where he collapsed and passed out.</p>
<p>He came to a couple of hours later to the sound of the FaceTime notification chime from his iPhone. He tried to focus his eyes and figure out where he was and why he was there when the entirety of his afternoon cookout came back to him. "Fuck. Fuck. Fuck." he chanted under his breath as he tried looking at everything everywhere all at once for red spores and blue ooze. His relief in finding neither was immense. 
<p>His phone continued to chime and he realized that his left hand was vibrating. He looked down to see it clutched there. All that, he thought, and I still grabbed my phone. He snorted as he swiped Accept.
<p>"Did I ruin a catnap?" Belinda asked, smiling until she saw the look on Stephen's face. "Steve? You okay? You look terrified!"</p>
<p>"Sorry! Sorry." Stephen said, trying to collect himself. "Yeah, I was catnapping. I was just startled by the notification chime. Everything's alright." He forced a smile. "How's the trip? The kids okay?"</p>
<p>"You wouldn't believe it. They packed mountain bikes into a helicopter – a freakin' helicopter! - then dropped the kids off at the top of the mountain behind my parents'. Steve, they rode them down the mountain. Halfway down there was a catered picnic set up in this beautiful valley. The kids didn't actually look at their phones for almost six hours straight. It was pretty amazing."</p>
<p>"Six hours? New record. Nice."</p>
<p>"Yeah. The kids liked it so much they're doing it again tomorrow, then, when they get back, they'll do some horseback riding."</p>
<p>"Kelsi been in the lake yet?"</p>
<p>"Too cold, poor thing. She was so sad until she heard about the helicopters and horses, then, somehow, she managed to get over it."</p>
<p>Stephen snickered. "She's a trooper, our Kelsi is."</p>
<p>"You enjoying your 'you' time?"</p>
<p>"Haven't even thought of grading a paper yet."</p>
<p>"Fantastic! Glad you're taking it easy. I miss you, hon."</p>
<p>"Yeah, miss you, too. Make sure you say 'howdy' to your parents for me."</p>
<p>Belinda laughed. "Yeah, I'll get right on that. Take care of you."</p>
<p>"Back atcha. Love ya, babe." Stephen ended the FaceTime call and lay back in bed. <em>Take care of me,</em> he thought. <em>Good advice.</em> He put his iPhone on the charger and crawled under the covers. He looked at his desk in the corner of the room and saw the pile of AP History papers awaiting his judgment. <em>Yeah, no.</em></p>
<p>Stephen fell asleep.</p>


<h5>Day Three</h5>
<p>Stephen woke up and reached for his phone. 2:12pm. "Three for three after noon," he groaned. "Yay me."  Everything hurt. His entire body ached. His head throbbed. His joints were stiff. His skin was warm to the touch. Everything was too bright. He was exhausted in a way he hadn't been since...well...ever.</p> 
<p>Slowly, he climbed out of bed and limped his way to the bathroom. When he got to the mirror he squinted against the brightness of the light and examined himself: red pupils, red skin. <em>That can't be right,</em> he thought. He turned the faucet on, cupped his hands, and splashed water on his face a couple of times. He looked back at the mirror. <me>Shit.</em> His pupils and his skin were still red. The red shifted, becoming more prominent in one area, then fading while another area brightened. It pulsed.</p>
<p>"Yeah," he said turning away. "Definitely gonna lay back down now." He once again ignored the pile of AP History papers and climbed back into bed.</p>


<h5>Day Four</h5>
<p>Stephen slept the entire day away. All 24 hours of it. The FaceTime notification chime didn't stand a chance at waking him up. Nor did the FaceTime voicemail notifications, the email notifications, the text notifications, the phone call ringtone set to Yakety Sax, or the phone's voicemail notifications.</p>
<p>Some time during the early morning he'd begun exhaling crimson red spores.</p>


<h5>Day Five</h5>
<p>Between the 24 hours of sleep the previous day, the 12 hours of sleep the day before that, and waking up after noon today, Stephen had slept for a grand total of 53 hours. He woke up feeling fantastic.</p>
<p>It hadn't been a dreamless sleep, this magnificent sleep of his. His remembered his dreams had been very vivid. In the beginning he was all alone in a pitch black void. Occasionally he'd see his wife, children, and parents; his childhood friends and pets; his colleagues from work and his bowling buddies. They'd flashed in front of him briefly, his heart flaring with love and a sense of belonging each time it happened, but they always disappeared all too quickly, leaving him to feel little but sadness and disconnection. Then, slowly, so slowly he couldn't detect the change, only the effect of it, a warm, red light grew around him. It illuminated dozens, then hundreds, then countless bright orange filaments connecting innumerable soft, yellow points of light.</p>
<p>Pulses, all colors of the rainbow, raced across the filaments. He looked down at himself and saw that he, too, was a soft yellow point of light connected to the others by the same orange filaments. He thought of his wife and kids, and when he did, he sent out deep, red pulses. They moved through the filaments to the yellow lights nearest him, then the ones next to them, and so forth, until the red pulses had spread to the entire colony of yellow lights.  He felt the colored pulses of emotion and information flow through and around him from the other yellow lights. Red was love. Green was satisfaction. Orange was anticipation. Blue was hunger. Purple was fear.</p>
<p>There was an entire rainbow of colors for an entire galaxy of information.</p>
<p>Positive emotions were shared widely while negative emotions spread only as far as they needed to before being contained. When this happened, the colony would send soothing red and green pulses until the disturbed section of the colony was okay again.</p>
<p>The feeling of connection, of love and belonging, went deeper and further than anything Stephen had experienced his entire-</p>
<p>The FaceTime notification chime interrupted his thoughts. He grabbed for his phone without thinking,  swiped Accept, then tapped Audio Only.
<p>"Stephen! Where have you been? I was so worried!" said Belinda.</p>
<p><em>She'd be pulsing red and purple,</em> Stephen thought. "Sorry honey. I graded all the AP History papers in one go," he said, glancing at the untouched pile of papers on his desk. "I muted the notifications on my phone and cranked AC/DC for a day and a half straight. I finally got through them then crashed. I forgot to unmute my phone. I just woke up, like, two minutes ago." <em>I wonder what color the bullshit pulse is?</em></p>
<p>"Thank goodness I'm not there to smell your breath or your B.O."</p>
<p>"Definitely rank."</p>
<p>"So, audio only, huh?"</p>
<p>"Yeah. Just woke up. Hair's every which way. Probably crusties in my nose. Just ew. How are the kids?"</p>
<p>"Turns out Kelsi did finally get in the lake. My parents bought wet suits for all the kids so they could play water polo."</p>
<p>"Water polo? In Lake Tahoe?"</p>
<p>"Oh yeah. They bought buoys, swim lane dividers, and floating goals. I guess their pool is currently being renovated. Get this. Cousin Dave's kids are getting into diving, so my parents are putting an official Olympic-sized diving platform and pool area in."</p>
<p>"Jiminy Cricket."</p>
<p>"Language!" Belinda giggled.</p>
<p>"Sorry! Sorry! Hey babe, I hope you're a having good time, too, but not having eaten for like a day and a half-"</p>
<p>"I sense another cookout coming up."</p>
<p>Stephen shuddered at the word. "You bet. Gonna go get the burgers and fixins ready now."</p>
<p>"Love you. Don't forget to shower."</p>
<p>"It's job one. Love you, too." He ended the FaceTime call and looked at the time. "3:18. After noon. Woo."</p>
<p>He made his way to the bathroom and looked in the mirror – eyes and skin still a deep, blood red. <em>Same color as the mushroom,</em> he thought. He sighed, and when he did, he saw a small cloud of crimson red spores erupt from his mouth.</p>
<p>"That's new," he said, exhaling more spores.</p>
<p>He bowed his head and closed his eyes. He saw the connections from his dream. Red light pulsed toward him. <em>I have to learn what these connection are called,</em> he thought, and a word floated in front of his closed eyes: <em>mycelium</em>. He was so surprised that he opened his eyes and lost the connection. He felt an enormous sense of loss. Disconnection. He closed his eyes again. Multi-colored pulses flowed every which way. <em>I think they're laughing,</em> he thought. Another message floated in front of his closed eyes: <em>We. We're laughing.</em> He looked down and saw that he was sending out multi-colored pulses of laughter, too.</p>
<p>He opened his eyes, confident he could get the connection back when he wanted to, and walked back to the bedroom. He saw new mushroom growth everywhere – in the high corners of the walls, on the nightstands, on the headboard, on his desk. Not, however, on his AP History papers. <em>Huh,</em> he thought. <em>You don't want to touch the AP History papers either.</em> He followed the trail of blood red mushrooms out into the hall and down the stairs. Mushrooms grew everywhere. He glanced out the window and saw the table on the deck table covered with mushrooms.</p>
<p>He closed his eyes and touched the mushroom on the wall next to him. It <em>(We)</em> pushed back against his <em>(our)</em> hand. He <em>(We)</em> opened his <em>(our)</em> eyes. The connection remained. They - Stephen and the mushroom colony - had merged. They looked all around them and saw the fibrous orange connections running all around the room, up through the ceiling to the second floor, and out to the deck and table. <em>Wicked cool,</em> they thought. The pulses turned an electric blue. <em>Yeah, we're getting a might peckish.</em> They went to the refrigerator, got the last two packages of meat from the freezer, and tore off the packaging. They grabbed them, one in each hand. Blue ooze came out of their left hand, breaking down and absorbing the meat.</p>
<p><em>Neat trick,</em> they thought.</p>
<p>They took the other handful of meat, broke it into chunks, and threw them around the room. Blue liquid oozed all over the first floor. After they'd thrown the last hunk of meat, green and red pulses flowed toward them, faster and faster and brighter and brighter, until the pulses were all they could see. <em>Well, that sure is something,</em> they thought, then passed out.</p> 


<h5>Day 6</h5>
<p>Stephen came to the next day to frenzied blue flashing. He bolted upright, eyes wide with panic. He pulsed purple to the colony – <em>Purple pulse? Colony?</em> He thought. <em>What the fuck?</em>  - as he tried to remember who and where he was. The colony responded with red and green. <em>Ohhhhh. Oh yeah,</em> he thought, settling down. <em>No 'I' or 'me,' only 'Us' and 'They.' There is no Stephen, only The Colony</em>. They pulsed red for a moment, then started pulsing blue again.</p>
<p>"Let's see what we have to eat," they said. They went to the fridge and the freezer. No meat left. They caught movement out of the corner of their eye and saw a fawn munching on the flowers and new shoots in the garden. They moved slowly toward the door to the deck and opened it even more slowly. They began oozing blue liquid and jumped 20 feet over the deck, over the railing, and onto the deer's back. The blue ooze flowed over the deer, making quick work of it. They brought what was left of the deer inside for them to consume.</p>
<p>They spent the rest of the day and evening in the house, communing and learning about themselves. As day turned to night, there were fewer and fewer thoughts and feelings that could be categorized as Stephen's. At first, he was alarmed over the loss of autonomy, but by evening they accepted it, and sometime, in the early hours of the morning, they eagerly embraced it.</p>
<p><em>Family,</em> they thought, amidst a storm of pulsing red light.</p> 

<h5>Day 7</h5>
<p>They covered every surface downstairs – the floor, the ceiling, the walls, the furniture, the appliances.</>
<p>They heard a vehicle pull into the driveway. </p>
<p>They heard its doors slam shut.</p>
<p>They heard muffled talking. </p>
<p>Blue pulses erupted throughout the colony.</p>
<p>They heard a key in the lock. </p>
<p>The front door opened. </p>
<p>"Stephen! We're home from the Family Picnic!"</p>
<p>They oozed blue liquid. Their blue pulses suffused with oranges and greens. <em>A Family Picnic,</em> they thought.</p.

<h2>
Death by Toilet Paper
</h2>

<p>He'd been sleeping hard lately, having pulled oodles of doubles at Georgia-Pacific pumping out all the extra toilet paper people were clamoring for in the first weeks of Coronavirus (Commodavirus, his coworkers gleefully called it...Brown Gold) so when his wife started pounding on the front door, screaming his name at three in the morning, he registered it only in his dream – a quiet morning fishing on the Siletz River turned Walmart-wide, no holds barred TP fracas. He snorted, mumbled "three ply," and turned over while the thing that had replaced his wife in bed with him gently stroked his hair, telling him, in his wife's voice, that it was all just a bad dream and everything was going to be alright, as its teeth lengthened - sharpening to points - and its hands became talons.</p>

<h2>
Stave V<br />The End Of It
</h2>

<p>There was no blow to the head. There was no slipping into unconsciousness. Scrooge blinked and the bed curtains were back in place. He edged to the side of the bed and tentatively pulled back the bed curtain with one finger. </p>
<p>Yes! The bed was his own. The room was his own. Best and happiest of all, the Time before him was his own.</p>
<p>"Thank God!" said Scrooge, then chuckled at what he'd said.</p>
<p>Scrooge took a long hot shower, got himself a nice hot meal, then collapsed into bed and slept all through Christmas and into the next day.</p>
<p>When he awoke bright and early on December the 26th, he immediately opened his window to let in some fresh air. Scrooge breathed deeply, enjoying the cold air washing across his face for a long moment, then looked up into the bright blue sky which was, he noted, gloriously free of be-chained spirits wailing and lamenting the difficulties of others' victimhood.</p>
<p>"Bah! Humbug!" said Scrooge, closing the window then making ready to go to his counting house.</p>
<p>Those who saw Scrooge walking to work that day saw a man renewed; a man with a spring in his step; a man who had glimpsed the tragic comedy of the Heavens themselves and turned away in the knowledge that he was better. To Scrooge's way of thinking, he wasn't sure whether or not any of it had happened, but he was sure it didn't matter; all that mattered was that he lived his life by his Principles of Reason, the very same Principles that allowed him to win at life every day of the year.</p>
<p>When Scrooge got to his counting house, he decided to not start a fire, instead finding pen and paper; what he wrote was simple: Help Wanted, Clerk.</p>
<p>Scrooge sat patiently then, watching his pocket watch as it moved from nine o'clock to nine oh five to nine fifteen. When his watch read nine twenty-three he heard the bell above the door ding and the stomping of feet. Bob Cratchit came into view looking sheepish and worried. </p>
<p>"Running late, Mr. Cratchit?" said Scrooge,  the smallest of smiles touching his lips.</p>
<p>"Sorry, sir. Indeed, sir. I was up late with the family telling Christmas Tales and drinking eggnog by the fire."</p>
<p>"Put this piece of paper in the window," said Scrooge, handing over the 'Help Wanted' sign.</p>
<p>The clerk put the sign in the window then turned to Scrooge.</p>
<p>"You're fired, Mr. Cratchit." said Scrooge, picking up a pen and starting in on the ledgers in front of him; the end of the fiscal year was always busy, so many peoples' money problems became even more problematic during the Holiday Season. He had many properties to foreclose on. "You came in late today despite your promise to come in early."</p>
<p>Bob Cratchit lowered his head and opened the door to leave.</p>
<p>"Oh, Cratchit," said Scrooge, closing the ledger in front of him and looking down his nose at his ex-clerk. "In lieu of two weeks notice and pay, please accept my best wishes for your boy, Tiny Tim."</p>
<p>As Cratchit left the office, Scrooge grabbed another ledger to work on from the very large pile on his desk. He had no further intercourse with Spirits, and had learned to keep Christmas in his heart, in his own way, ever after.</p>
