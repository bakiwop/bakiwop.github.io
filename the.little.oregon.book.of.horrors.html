<p>Jim stopped the truck where the forest road ended and the hiking trail started. There was a small, hand painted sign that read: Trail Head.</p>
<p>"I have got to get a picture of that!" said Ryan. He grabbed his phone, hopped out of the truck, and took a couple pics.</p>
<p>"You've had to 'get a picture of that' for just about everything so far," said Jim, smiling as he turned the ignition off and got out.</p>
<p>They went to the back of the truck to grab their gear.</p>
<p>"I've been looking forward to this for years!" said Ryan. "Years! Come on! Open up! Open up!"</p>
<p>"You're practically vibrating," Jim replied, going through his jumble of keys. He eventually found the right one, unlocked the truck topper, and opened the tailgate.</p>
<p>"So exciting!" Ryan shouted. He snatched his backpack from the truck and got it on in record time. He looked at Jim and smiled. "Oregon! Woo!"</p>
<p>Jim looked sidelong at his new friend while grabbing the extra water. "You do have forests in Wisconsin."</p>
<p>"Yeah, but not like this!" Ryan gripped his backpack's straps, sighed, and looked up. It was a beautiful summer day in the Coastal range. The deep blue sky was framed by towering Sitka spruce whose trunks were swallowed by the ferns mobbing the forest floor. There wasn't a level piece of ground in sight. A cool breeze blew off the Pacific. "I can't believe its freakin' August! Do you know what the temp and humidity are in Wisconsin right now? 95!"</p>
<p>"Is that the temp or the humidity?" asked Jim.</p>
<p>"Both!"</p>
<p>"That," Jim said, grabbing his backpack and buckling it on, "truly sucks."</p>
<p>"It's reason number three hundred twenty seven why I wanted to move out here."</p>
<p>"Well," Jim said, grabbing a fanny pack and slamming the tailgate shut, "now that you're finally out here, let's get going on your first PNW hike." He clipped the fanny pack around his waist, shrugged his backpack a couple of times to get it seated properly, then gestured for Ryan to lead the way.</p>
<p>The two of them spent the next couple hours hiking – gaining and losing hundreds upon hundreds of feet of elevation. </p>
<p>"The views! The drop-offs!" said Ryan for the hundredth time that day.  The-"</p>
<p>"-water breaks," finished Jim. He stopped, shrugged off his pack, grabbed two waters, and handed one to Ryan.</p>
<p>"Stupid beautiful," said Ryan, drinking. He wiped some sweat off his brow with his tee. "This is all just so stupid beautiful."</p>
<p>They found places to sit and drink their water while they enjoyed the quiet psithurism of the wind blowing through the trees and the burble of the water flowing around rocks in the nearby creek.</p>
<p>After a bit, they got up and brushed themselves off. Ryan tossed his empty water bottle to Jim, who utterly and completely failed to catch it.</p>
<p>"Dude," said Ryan walking toward him, picking up the water bottle. "Fast hands." He tried to hand it to him, but Jim's hand wouldn't close around the bottle. Ryan looked at him more closely, all the blood had drained from Jim's face and he was trembling ever so slightly. "Jim? Hey Jim!" He waved his hands in front of Jim's face. "Earth to Jim!" He snapped his fingers.</p>
<p>Jim grabbed Ryan's hands so quickly he didn't see them move.</p>
<p>"Shh...shsshshhhh...shh...shsh," Jim managed through gritted teeth. </p>
<p>Ryan tried to catch Jim's eye. "Hey! Hey! What's wrong? Do you have a medical cond-"</p>
<p>Jim let go of Ryan's hands and grabbed his shoulders - he felt like he was being gripped by two overly-tightened vices – then spun him around.</p>
<p>Ryan got as far as,"Come on, man! What's going o-,"  before he saw the mama bear and two cubs thirty feet away from them, stopped on the trail where Ryan and Jim had just come from.</p>
<p>The bears were staring at them.</p>
<p>"Shit!" Whispered Ryan.</p>
<p>"Yes," Jim whispered back. "Shit."</p>
<p>"What are we gonna do, man?"</p>
<p>"Don't make any sudden moves. You'll startle them. Don't run. Their prey drive will kick in and they can run faster than Usain Bolt. You cannot outrun them. Don't try to climb a tree. They can climb trees almost as fast as they can run."</p>
<p>"Jesus Christ! Then what the hell are we supposed to do."</p>
<p>"Don't worry. I brought a...deterrent."</p>
<p>The bear cubs were getting curious and started toward the two hikers. Momma bear was decidedly unhappy with this turn of events and began huffing. </p>
<p>"Okay. I'm gonna grab something from my fanny pack, then we have to rush toward the bears making ourselves as big as we can while yelling at the top of our lungs."</p>
<p>"That," said Ryan, "does not sound like it should be Plan A." He felt Jim remove his hands from his shoulders. He heard a zipper being opened slowly. He heard a snick followed by Jim mumbling something that sounded like, 'not again.' He heard another snick then risked a look back. Jim was holding a revolver.</p>
<p>"You're gonna shoot them?" asked Ryan. "You can't just shoot them!"</p>
<p>"I would never shoot a bear," responded Jim. "Besides, this is just a little .22. It'd just tick 'em off."</p>
<p>"So why-"</p>
<p>"Alright, on the count of three, we're gonna rush the bears."</p>
<p>"But-"</p>
<p>"One."</p>
<p>"Are you sure? This doesn't-"</p>
<p>"Two."</p>
<p>"I don't know if I can-"</p>
<p>"Remember. Make yourself big and loud."</p>
<p>"Okay," whimpered Ryan.</p>
<p>The cubs continued to slowly make their way toward the hikers. Momma bear started pounding her front paws on the ground and clacking her teeth between huffs.</p>
<p>"Three!" shouted Jim.</p>
<p>Ryan roared. He threw his arms out and flapped them like he was trying to fly. He hopped toward the bears and screamed, "Go away, bears! Go away, scary bears!"</p>
<p>The cubs ran back toward their mother. Momma bear's lower lip protruded and her ears flattened.</p>
<p>Ryan shouted. "I think it's working!" He glanced back at Jim, who was pointing the gun at his leg. Ryan stopped his flapping, hopping, yelling advance and, through his confusion, said, "Wha-?" </p>
<p>"That was really something," said Jim, breaking into an insane grin that showed entirely too many teeth. His eyes were huge but he wasn't allowing himself to see much of what was happening. "I mean...really fantastic." He pulled the trigger.</p>
<p>Ryan heard a pop and felt a burning sting in his calf. He collapsed, grabbed his calf, and started screaming. </p>
<p>Momma bear charged.</p>
<p>Jim stood still for a moment and watched, then turned and ran for all he was worth. <em>Lucky for me,</em> he thought, <em>I don't have to outrun the bear.</em></p>
<p>Ryan felt an immense pressure, first on his back, then on his right shoulder. <em>Huh,</em> he thought, <em>just like having wisdom teeth pulled – all pressure, no pain.</em> He was violently jerked around then dropped. He felt lightheaded. Confused. He was annoyed by a high-pitched wailing, then astonished to discover he was the one making it. His vision blurred then cleared. He saw his arm lying on the trail a couple feet away. "That," he wheezed, spitting up foamy blood bubbles, "is not right." He wished for his vision to blur again. He felt more pressure on his back, then heard cracking and crunching. <em>Ah,</em> he thought while passing out, <em>there's the pain.</em></p>
<p>Momma bear sniffed around the unconscious Ryan then gathered up her cubs and headed down the trail the way they'd come. Ryan came to in time to see the bears round a bend in the trail and disappear from sight. <em>Who knew bear butts were furry?</em> he thought. <em>Furry bear butts! Furry bear butts!</em> Ryan started giggling, or at least he felt like giggling, but his crushed lungs would not allow him the breath to do it, so he just ended up convulsing for a moment. <em>Furry bear butts!</em> He tried getting up but couldn't move his arm or his legs. <em>Can't move my other arm either!</em> he thought, which caused more convulsions. His vision started tunneling. He felt an infinitely increasing weariness and detachment. <em>Oregon. Woo,</em> he thought. </p>
<p>Ryan had one, final, overwhelming urge to live. All people from Wisconsin experience it when they're about to die. <em>I'm never gonna eat cheese again,</em> he thought. His body and mind rebelled at such a horrible and alien concept, but nonetheless, not even the power of cheese was enough.</p>
<p>Ryan died.</p>

<h2>
I Got Wood
</h2>

<p>Scrooge woke slowly; there was a small circle of light surrounded by darkness; there was a sensation of swimming up out of the darkness toward the light, there was a sense of comfort and peace as he rose higher; upon reaching the light, Scrooge saw faces spaced evenly around the edge of the circle staring down at him; there was a sense of confusion and slowly dawning horror as his bedroom ceiling came into focus and he realized the faces were those of the ghosts he had seen wailing outside earlier.</p>
<p>The faces disappeared and Scrooge sat up, breathing hard, trying to glance in front, behind, above, and below himself all at once. </p>
<p>"Bah humbug!" said Scrooge out loud, scaring himself even more in breaking the heavy silence that hung in his chambers.</p>
<p>Marley's Ghost bothered him exceedingly. Every time he resolved within himself, after mature inquiry, that it was all a dream, his mind flew back again, like a strong spring released, to its first position, and presented the same problem to be worked all through, "Was it a dream or not?"</p>
<p>Scrooge glanced toward the window and saw light outside. "I made it through the night!" he said. "With no further visits from ghosts!"</p>
<p><em>Dream</em>, thought Scrooge, figuring Marley had been a bit of indigestion after all. He immediately felt better.</p>
<p>Scrooge took his time getting ready for work, enjoying his morning ablutions. He put on his favorite suit and great coat, and made his way down the stairs, barely giving the mischievous knocker a second thought as he walked through the doorway, locking the door behind him.</p>
<p>He was about to set off down the walkway when he froze, seeing a Green Line train sitting on the street in front of his house. This was an unusual sight for Scrooge as the Green Line didn't stop in front of his house, or, in fact, go down Summit Avenue at all.</p>
<p>Scrooge slowly walked toward the train and saw the conductor beckoning him over.</p>
<p>Not a chance, thought Scrooge as he turned his back on the train and headed for his counting house.  He turned the first corner and there in front of him was the Green Line train; Scrooge glanced behind him with a sense of dread and finality, and saw the same Green Line car - he could even make out the conductor beckoning toward him.</p>
<p>With a sigh and a growing sense of frustration, Scrooge walked to the other side of the street and cut down an alley before he was stopped short, seeing the Green Line car and the beckoning conductor. His frustration outgrew his fear; he stormed up to the train and was about to knock on the door when it opened to the smiling conductor.</p>
<p>"Green Line, sir," said the conductor.</p>
<p>"I do not take public transportation," said Scrooge. "I can smell the cheap liquor and unwashed humanity from out here. I am walking to my counting house. If you have business to conduct with me, dear conductor, and I'm not sure you do, then you can meet me there within the hour!"</p>
<p>Scrooge turned around and ran straight into the Green Line car. He had to take a step back as the doors opened and the conductor said, "Green Line, sir."</p>
<p>"Bah!" said Scrooge as he got on the car, holding his nose both literally and figuratively.</p>
<p>"$3.50, sir." said the conductor, shutting the door.</p>
<p>Scrooge looked around the car, spotting various lumps of clothing that, he assumed, must be sleeping people, for the snoring sounds and smell of cheap wine did indeed permeate the air. He turned back to the conductor. "I- "</p>
<p>"$3.50, sir," repeated the conductor.</p>
<p>"- will not pay to use public transport which has already been funded by my taxes!"</p>
<p>"$3.50, sir," said the conductor yet again.</p>
<p>"Did you hear me?" said Scrooge. "I will not pay twice for the dubious honor of using public transportation for which my taxes ha- "</p>
<p>"If my sources are correct, sir," said the conductor, "you've paid exactly zero in taxes for going on twenty-five years now, correct?"</p>
<p>"Well, I- "</p>
<p>"In fact, you've received rather large refunds, if I'm not mistaken."</p>
<p>"You see- "</p>
<p>"These 'inebriated lumps of unwashed humanity' as you think of them have actually paid to utilize this conveyance, not to mention paid their taxes," said the conductor. "You aren't trying to tell me that they have more money and sense than you?</p>
<p>"I never carry mo-"</p>
<p>"I believe, sir, that if you check the pockets of your fine suit there, you will find a couple of dollars."</p>
<p>Scrooge put his hand in his pocket and pulled out a five dollar bill. He handed the money to the conductor who palmed it. Scrooge waited for his change.</p>
<p>The conductor pointed to a sign reading, 'No change given.' "Off we go."</p>
<p>Scrooge, never having ridden light rail before, found himself on the floor as the train accelerated. He rubbed his head where he had banged it as he pulled himself upright with one of the grab bars. He was unsure of where to sit before deciding to sit as close to the conductor – being the least worst smelling thing on the train – as possible.</p>
<p>"First stop, Ramsey Junior High," said the conductor.</p>
<p>"Look here," started Scrooge, "I must get to my count- "</p>
<p>The conductor looked at Scrooge in his passenger-view mirror and pointed to a sign which read 'No talking to the conductor while the train is in motion.'</p>
<p>"I don't care!" shouted Scrooge. "I demand to know who you- "</p>
<p>Scrooge was stopped short by another look from the conductor as he pointed to yet another sign which read, 'I'm the ghost of Christmas Past.'</p>
<p>Scrooge, feeling suddenly uncommunicative, looked out his window, concentrating on rubbing his sore head and not looking at the other passengers.  As he watched the world go by, he noticed a strange fog and twilight come and go every block or two. He turned toward the conductor and was about to ask where they were going when the conductor looked at him in the passenger-view mirror and pointed to a sign reading 'Ramsey Junior High.'</p>
<p>"Oh. Right," Scrooge mumbled.</p>
<p>Scrooge put his head down, promising himself to look at nothing else and ignore the conductor completely. An indeterminable amount of time later, Scrooge felt the train slowing down. He betrayed his earlier promise to himself and looked around at his fellow passengers, seeing that some were no longer there and others had joined him in the car despite the train not having stopped once since he got on.</p>
<p>The train stopped and the conductor got up and stood in front of Scrooge. "Ramsey Junior High. This is your stop, sir."</p>
<p>Scrooge couldn't bring himself to look at the conductor, but shouted, "This is kidnapping! I demand you take me back to my house! I will not- "</p>
<p>At his outburst, Scrooge became aware that some of the huddled passengers began moving toward him. Strange sounds emanated from the piles of clothes and winter coats and bags. Strange, unearthly sounds.</p>
<p>Scrooge looked at the conductor in a panic. The conductor stared back and said, "Ramsey Junior High. This is your stop, sir."</p>
<p>As Scrooge stood up the other passengers returned to their seats with sounds that wavered between snickering and snarling. The conductor walked off the train with Scrooge fast on his heels.</p>
<p>As eager as Scrooge was to leave the train and its passengers behind him, he hesitated on the last step as he looked about him for the first time. "Good Heaven!" he said, clasping his hands together. “I was a boy here! The smells. The sounds. They're all just as I remember them."</p>
<p>Just then a red rubber kickball bounced past Scrooge. He looked to where the ball had come from and saw dozens of children running around the playground. He saw kids playing hopscotch and catch; he saw kids playing tag and four square; he saw groups of girls huddled together whispering about god knows who and groups of boys huddled together whispering about god knows what.</p>
<p>The conductor tapped him on the shoulder and pointed to a far corner of the playground where a lone boy, smaller than most, was sitting with his head hung between his knees. </p>
<p>"That's me!" said Scrooge. A flood of memories engulfed him: sadness, loneliness, fear. He hadn't cared for recess, or school for that matter.</p>
<p>The bell rang and the children started racing toward the teacher, lining up to be counted before they went in. The child Ebeneezer got up slowly, started running to get in line, then tripped. No one noticed. No one offered their assistance or their scorn. As Ebeneezer held his scraped knee, the teachers and students in their lines started inside; he limped to get to the back of the line as fast as he could and then was lost to sight of Scrooge and the conductor.</p>
<p>"Spirit! It really was me? How is this possible? It cannot be! It's not possible. I've had two blows to the head recently, I'm probably lying on my bedroom floor right now dreaming all this nonsense."</p>
<p>"The second blow to your head," said the conductor, "was received right here in this car. Surely you can't count that one if you believe none of this is actually happening."</p>
<p>"Why did you bring me here? Why make me revisit this horrible time in my life? You can see no one cared about me. No one paid attention to me. I'd given control of my happiness to others and they completely ignored me. It was here where I began to learn that my own happiness was my own responsibility. I learned to not rely on others for that happiness, but instead create it myself."</p>
<p>Just then they heard, from across the playground, "I'm fine! Leave me alone!"</p>
<p>They turned and saw three classmates and a teaching assistant looking on as Ebeneezer glared at them before entering the school. The teaching assistant's face showed concern, and the children hung their heads in embarrassment.</p>
<p>"Why does he do that," asked one of the children. "He never lets anybody help him; or play when we ask him to."</p>
<p>The teaching assistant's response was inaudible as they all turned to follow Ebeneezer into the school.</p>
<p>"You see, Scrooge," said the conductor, "you chose to believe no one cared or had any compassion. You see now the reality of the situation."</p>
<p>"Reality is an absolute!" shouted Scrooge. "I chose to believe only what I experienced! The factual requirements of a person's life are set by their nature. People are individuals, each with their own body, their own mind, and their own life."</p>
<p>"Those children and that teacher wanted to help you. They wanted to play with you."</p>
<p>"Bah humbug!"</p>
<p>The spirit disappeared, and before Scrooge could think to be surprised, the conductor called from inside the train, "Next stop Fezziwig's Billiards and Bollocks."</p>
<p>"I've had enough, Spirit!" shouted Scrooge. "Take me home now!"</p>
<p>"Next stop Fezziwig's Billiards and Bollocks."</p>
<p>"I demand you bring me home!"</p>
<p>"I've a job to do, sir. Not worth it to take you home before the next stop. Not worth losing my job over."</p>
<p>"I never! If you don't take me- "</p>
<p>"Sorry, sir," said the conductor, looking anything but. "I'm not the one to complain to. The decision of where you go and what you see are above my pay grade. Next stop Fezziwig's Bollards and Bollocks."</p>
<p>"So you're just the help," spat Scrooge. "I knew it! Fine, let's finish this so I can get back to a decent night's sleep!"</p>
<p>Scrooge climbed the steps of the train. When he got to the top, the conductor held out his and said, "$3.50 sir, unless you have a transfer."</p>
<p>"What's a tr- "</p>
<p>"$3.50, sir."</p>
<p>"You are shaking me down," said Scrooge. "I'm most unhappy with your service! I demand to talk to your sup- "</p>
<p>"Don't let others control your happiness, sir," replied the conductor. "$3.50, sir."</p>
<p>Scrooge felt around in his pocket and found another five dollar bill. He handed it over to the conductor and demanded his change.</p>
<p>The conductor pointed to a sign reading, 'No change given.' "Off we go."</p>
<p>Scrooge wisely grabbed onto a pole to steady himself as the train accelerated away. He sat down by the conductor again and put his head down and rubbed his temples, just waiting for his bad dream to be over.</p>
<p>Sometime later, how long he could not gauge, he felt the train begin to slow. Scrooge dared look out the window. It was snowing hard. On the corner he saw a large, lit up sign flashing 'Fezziwig's Billiards and Bollocks' attached to a building occupying nearly the entire block. </p>
<p>Scrooge hadn't been here in ages; had in fact, foreclosed the mortgage of Fezziwig's many years ago. When he looked closer at the building he could see what looked to be a party. He most definitely did not want to go in there.</p>
<p>Scrooge heard the conductor's footsteps stop in front of him. The conductor said, "Next stop. Fezziwig's Billiards and Bollocks."</p>
<p>"Please, Spirit. I cannot bear to go in there."</p>
<p>"Scrooge, you have free will. You can either go in there or stay in here." </p>
<p>Scrooge opened his mouth to say he would stay here, thank you very much, but then heard slithering, slinking, skittering noises from further inside the car. They were getting louder. They sounded...excited? Anticipatory? Eager? How could slithering sound eager, wondered Scrooge, before darting past the conductor into the falling snow.</p>
<p>"Wise choice, sir." said the conductor, appearing next to Scrooge.</p>
<p>Outside the snow was swirling; great drifts were piling up against houses, cars, and fences. The blinking of Fezziwig's sign made the snow jump and move as if it were alive.</p>
<p>"Every year," said the conductor, "Fezziwig threw an enormous Christmas party, inviting everyone from the neighborhood, all his employees and their families, and all his customers and their families. None were turned away. Free music. Free food and drink. Nothing but joy and care for his fellow man. Come, Scrooge. Let's warm ourselves and partake of this delightful feast."</p>
<p>The conductor and Scrooge entered the building and found themselves surrounded by happy revelry at every turn, until they found Scrooge in the corner talking to a group of Fezziwig's investors. This group was neither drinking, nor feasting, nor dancing. Their heads were together and they were as serious a group as ever had been at a celebration such as this. </p>
<p>A bell rung from the other side of the room. Soon enough Fezziwig - old, rotund, delightful Fezziwig – had gotten most of the party-goers to pay attention. "A toast," shouted Fezziwig so all could hear. "A toast to all of you for another wonderful year!"</p>
<p>The crowd shouted and drank their agreement.</p>
<p>Fezziwig rang the bell again.</p>
<p>"Another toast!" shouted Fezziwig. "To the man who lined up all those investors who will be taking Fezziwig's Billiards and Bollocks international this upcoming year. To Ebeneezer Scrooge!"</p>
<p>At the sound of his name, the young Ebeneezer tore himself away from the huddled investors and smiled greatly at his boss, raising a glass as he did so. The crowd roared their approval and drank to his good will. Ebeneezer returned to the investor huddle and the party continued on around them.</p>
<p>"But that's not what the investors were for, was it Scrooge" said the conductor. "By the middle of next year, the investors purchased Fezziwig's out from under him, took out gigantic loans, cut salaries and wages across the board, liquidated everything not bolted down, then sold the business for as much as they could, insuring that Fezziwig's would end in bankruptcy and ruin."</p>
<p>"It was business," said Scrooge. "I saw a way to make more money and I did!"</p>
<p>"And Fezziwig?" said the conductor. "Dead of a heart attack exactly one year from now?"</p>
<p>"Very unfortunate," said Scrooge, "but Fezziwig was as fool. All he wanted to do was keep going on the way things were. He never cottoned to the fact there was so much more money to be made. He should've listened to me. He should've gone along with my idea."</p>
<p>"Your idea to strip all the value from the business he spent decades building with the employees, neighbors and customers he called family? A single member of which decided to betray that trust."</p>
<p>"Don't point your moral outrage at me! You want to discuss morality? Each individual should act in his own best interest and is the proper beneficiary of his own action. In order to live, people must take self-interested action and reap the benefits thereof. Human life requires egoism!"</p>
<p>The room around them darkened. A newspaper blew into Scrooge's face. He felt the air around him turn hot and humid. Scrooge snatched the paper off and found himself outside the front door to Fezziwig's.</p>
<p>"Look inside," said the Spirit. "Then look outside."</p>
<p>Scrooge squinted into the darkness of Fezziwig's interior. It was a mess. Broken furniture and graffiti abounded. It was the opposite of merrymaking. It was abandonment and betrayal. All that was left was dust and cobwebs. When Scrooge looked outside, he saw dilapidated houses with unkempt lawns. Even though it was a beautiful summer afternoon, there were no children running around or people walking the street. There was no sound of laughter or smell of meat on the grill. All there was were boarded up houses and cracked pavement full of weeds.</p>
<p>Scrooge looked at the date on the newspaper he'd pulled from his face. It was five years after he had sold Fezziwig's.</p>
<p>"Spirit," said Scrooge. "These are things I cannot change, nor would I choose to if I could. Many people made a lot of money because of what I did."</p>
<p>"I believe you mean many people who already had more than enough money made even more money by taking away money from hundreds of people who no longer had a livelihood," said the conductor.</p>
<p>"The opportunity was there for anyone to take! Just because I had the brains and the courage to do it when nobody else did- "</p>
<p>"It's easier, Scrooge, to make rich people richer. It takes careful thought and planning to make sure most people have enough to live a good life."</p>
<p>"He with means- "</p>
<p>"Means more. Yes. Yes. He with means usually just means more trouble for those without." </p>
<p>"Bah! Humbug! Take me home, Spirit. Right now!"</p>
<p>The conductor disappeared then reappeared in the train. Scrooge ran to the door and pounded on it for all he was worth.</p>
<p>"Open up! I demand you open these doors."</p>
<p>The conductor ignored Scrooge and went about preparing to leave. Scrooge ran in front of the train and pointed at the conductor.</p>
<p>"I said let me on!"</p>
<p>The conductor pointed at the sign at the front of the train which read, 'No Service,' then drove directly at Scrooge.</p>
<p>Scrooge started screaming as he fainted dead away from shock.</p>


<br /><br />


<a class="titolo" id="stave.three"></a>
<h2>
Stave III<br />The Second of the Three Spirits
</h2>

<p>Scrooge woke up screaming, then realized his throat was rather sore so he stopped, for now, given the night he was having, though, he reserved the right to begin screaming again at a moment's notice. Oddly enough, Scrooge thought he still heard screaming. He took a moment to make sure it wasn't him; took another moment to ascertain that he was, indeed, back in his chambers, then got up to follow the sound of the screaming.</p>
<p>The screaming was rather loud and seemed to be coming from behind his closet door.</p>
<p>"This is my house," said Scrooge walking toward the door. "Whoever or whatever foul thing is in my closet, prepare to- "</p>
<p>As Scrooge laid his hand on the doorknob in mid-bluff, a strange voice called him by his name, and bade him enter. Since the screaming had stopped, Scrooge complied.</p>
<p>It was his own bedroom. There was no doubt about that. But it had undergone a surprising transformation. The closet was gone and the colors of his admittedly drab bedchamber were turned up to eleven. It was as if someone had taken a living picture and cranked up the HDR to worrying levels.</p>
<p>Scrooge looked behind him and saw his colorless bedroom, then looked back toward the closet and saw the bright, gleaming, over-saturated bedroom; and how he hadn't noticed before he couldn't say, but on his bed lay the biggest man Scrooge had ever laid eyes on. He had to be twelve feet tall and weight at least several hundred pounds more than Scrooge himself.</p>
<p>The creature lying on Scrooge's bed opened his mouth and screamed. Scrooge covered his ears and was about to run when the giant began laughing. It was a warm, inviting laugh. A laugh that did not make you the butt of a cruel joke but instead invited you to appreciate a clever joke well told. When the giant laughed a feast appeared around him: turkeys, hams, and chickens of all sizes; sausages, hot dogs, and brats prepared on a grill; chestnuts, strawberries, and apples looking freshly picked; butter cream, carrot, and red velvet cakes frosted to the nines; barrels of ale, casks of wine, and more juices than Scrooge could name. </p>
<p>"Waking up with a scream," exclaimed the giant. "How invigorating!"</p>
<p>Despite the giant's booming voice, Scrooge barely heard the giant speak. The giant, used to such behavior, clapped once, a loud, thunderous sound that would have gotten Scrooge's attention from even miles away. Scrooge focused on the giant in front of him.</p>
<p>"Come in!" exclaimed the giant. "Come in and know me better, man!"</p>
<p>Scrooge entered with his dander up. In his mind, one did not simply offer a spread such as the one laid out before him without wanting something in return. While any passerby would have described the giant's eyes as clear and kind, Scrooge's first thought when seeing the giant was 'used car salesman.'</p>
<p>The giant, as if reading Scrooge's mind, said, "I am the Ghost of Christmas Present. Look upon me!"</p>
<p>Scrooge did so, and seeing the loosely hung robe in shimmering emerald green, Croc'd feet, long curly hair, sparkling eye, cheery voice, and large suspect cigar held in one extra-large hand, Scrooge revised his initial impression and thought, 'trust fund frat bro.'</p>
<p>"You have never seen the like of me before!" exclaimed the Spirit.</p>
<p>"Every time I step foot on a used car lot or walk past fraternity row at the U," Scrooge made answer to it. "Spirit! Conduct me where you will and let us get this over with."</p>
<p>The Ghost of Christmas Present rose.</p>
<p>"Touch my robe!"</p>
<p>"Not a chance," replied Scrooge.</p>
<p>"Very well then. Grab an apple and we shall be off."</p>
<p>Scrooge did as he was told and held it fast.</p>
<p>His bed chamber, along with all the food and drink, save the apple in his hand, vanished instantly. They stood in a city street, snow falling pleasantly around them, yet Scrooge felt neither wind nor cold. It was evening and the neighborhood was full of children building snow forts and snow men while the sound of snow blowers and scraping shovels filled the air. Across the way in an open lot, defenders were preparing a snowball arsenal in a snow fort while attackers at the other end of the lot prepared their offensive ammunition. Christmas lights on houses, garages, trees, bushes, and lampposts blinked merrily. </p>
<p>"To be blunt," Scrooge said, ignoring the activity around him, instead staring pointedly at the cigar held in the giant's hand, "that is a peculiar smell coming from your cigar."</p>
<p>"Mind it not, Scrooge. Follow."</p>
<p>And perhaps it was the pleasure the good Spirit had in showing off this power of his, or else it was his own kind, generous, hearty nature, and his sympathy with all poor men, that led him straight to Scrooge's clerk's; for there he went, and took Scrooge with him, holding his apple; and on the threshold of the door the Spirit smiled, and stopped to bless Bob Cratchit’s dwelling with the smoke from his cigar.</p>
<p>The Spirit entered the house and Scrooge followed. They came upon the Cratchit family dining upon their Christmas Eve dinner. It was a humble spread but one well made. </p>
<p>The children, three girls and two boys, all heartily enjoying their Christmas Eve supper, were engrossed in their own discussions. Bob Cratchit leaned over to his wife and whispered, "The doctor said Tiny Tim isn't responding to the new medication. It looks like she'll try to enroll him in the study at the U she told us about."</p>
<p>They turned to look at their son, Tiny Tim, who, despite eating well, for they always made sure he had enough to eat so he could keep his strength up for the various procedures he endured, looked frail and small. Tiny Tim, though, as always, was putting up a brave front for his family.</p>
<p>"Will we be able to afford it?" said Mrs. Cratchit. "The doctor said it would be so expensive."</p>
<p>"We always find a way, dear," said Bob, grabbing his wife's hand.</p>
<p>Tiny Tim turned toward the two of them and smiled, having overheard their exchange, then turned back to his siblings, who were now arguing over who would have to clear the table.</p>
<p>"I'll do it," said Tiny Tim.</p>
<p>"You will not!" said Mrs. Cratchit. "You can barely walk with your crutches now. Come, children, let's start cleaning up. Bob, you take Tiny Tim over by the fire so he can warm himself."</p>
<p>With half-hearted groans, the children began clearing the table while Bob and Tiny Tim settled by the fire.</p>
<p>"Why do you always volunteer to do everything?" said Bob to his son, stroking his hair with worry.</p>
<p>"Dad, I believe we are here for each other. I want to help others and experience as much as I can while I can. God bless us, every one."</p>
<p>Bob gave his son a big hug and grabbed the book they had been reading together from the coffee table. They both faced the fire, then Bob started reading to Tiny Tim.</p>
<p>The Spirit turned toward Scrooge, "I see Bob reading alone by the fire, and crutches without an owner, if these shadows remain unaltered by the Future, the child will die."</p>
<p>Scrooge looked surprised. "Why tell me, Spirit? You cannot believe this is my fault? It looks as though I pay Bob enough to have a Christmas Eve dinner and to afford medical care for Tiny Tim. Surely you cannot ask any more from me?"</p>
<p>The Spirit, usually carefree and relaxed, looked disgustedly at Scrooge, "The meal was provided by the local food bank and their medical coverage is provided by MinnesotaCare."</p>
<p>"Then Bob should find a job that pays better!" said Scrooge. "It's a free market. He doesn't have to work for me. He should just find another job. It's simple self-interest and self-responsibility."</p>
<p>"Tiny Tim will die."</p>
<p>"Then let the God that Tiny Tim believes in save him! Your God is all-powerful, right? Let your all-powerful, all-knowing God do something for him."</p>
<p>Mrs. Cratchit and the other children finished in the kitchen and brought cups and Kemp's eggnog with them as they sat around the fire. </p>
<p>"A toast," said Bob. "Good will toward all!"</p>
<p>They raised their glasses and drank to the good of all mankind.</p>
<p>"Bah humbug!" said Scrooge. "They could all be out working this evening, shoveling sidewalks or plowing parking lots, instead of living off the charity of others. And look, over there, all those presents under the Christmas tree, probably provided by kindhearted fools who grabbed the children's names off an Angel Tree in Target or CVS."</p>
<p>Scrooge walked away from the warmth, light, and love of the house into the cold, dark night. "Take me back home, Spirit."</p>
<p>The giant turned to watch Scrooge leave and said, "You must first look at the apple in your hand."</p>
<p>Scrooge did as he was asked. The apple was shriveled and bruised. </p>
<p>"That is an apple from the tree of knowledge," said the Ghost. "It reflects in itself the knowledge and wisdom of the one who holds it."</p>
<p>As Scrooge watched the apple, it turned black, then to dust. </p>
<p>The Ghost appeared beside Scrooge.</p>
<p>"Without that apple," said the Spirit, "you are lost and have no way of getting home. I'm afraid I must leave you now."</p>
<p>Scrooge was about to protest but the Spirit disappeared into the falling snow which began to rage around them. Scrooge tried in vain to see Cratchit's house or any of the Christmas decorations lit nearby, but to no avail. Scrooge thrust his arms out in front of him and walked, hoping he was headed toward shelter; but hope soon turned to panic and, as the snow swirled wildly, stinging his face and hands, choking him when he breathed, Scrooge ran blindly. He made it only a couple of steps when he hit a tree, banging his head, knocking himself out.</p>

<h2>
Stave IV<br />The Last of the Spirits
</h2>

<p>Scrooge could have sworn he was awake. He thought his eyes were open. He raised his hands and felt his eyes to be open. He could blink. No matter what he did, though, he could see only blackness.  He looked all round himself, trying to find any light, or any thing, to focus on; slowly, out of the corner of his eye, he saw an even deeper blackness coalesce into a hooded form. The darkness of the hooded form made the previous blackness seem like a sunny day at high noon.</p>
<p>Scrooge had had enough. "Let me guess," he said. "You're the Ghost of Things Yet To Come."</p>
<p>The spirit answered not, but pointed with its hand.</p>
<p>Although well used to ghostly company by this time, Scrooge raged at the silent shape so much that his legs trembled before him, and he found that he could hardly stand.</p>
<p>"I don't care to go anywhere with you or see anything you have to offer, Spirit!" spat Scrooge. "I do not fear you, I only fear the time of mine you are sure to waste. You believe your purpose here is to do me good? The best good you could do me is to stop causing me concussions and letting me get a good night's sleep!"</p>
<p>The Spirit waved its arm at Scrooge and he saw a street scene. It was deathly cold out and a light snow was falling from a heavy sky. Two men were walking toward a bar when a street urchin ran toward them begging for money.</p>
<p>"Go away kid, ya bother me," said the first man.</p>
<p>"Oh, come on, Bill," said the second, grabbing his wallet and handing over a fiver. "Don't be such a Scrooge."</p>
<p>"Spirit!" said Scrooge, ignoring the rest of the scene. "I do not care what my legacy is, but if 'being a Scrooge' means not giving money to people who didn't earn it, than I, for one. am proud!"</p>
<p>The Spirit again waved its arm at Scrooge and the street scene changed to a hospital room. The room was crowded as two adults and four children stood vigil around a bed where a small child was hooked up to a heart monitor that had just gone from beeping to flat line.</p>
<p>"Tiny Tim!" screamed Mrs. Cratchit, squeezing her boy's hand.</p>
<p>Bob Cratchit silently cried and Tiny Tim's siblings held each other tightly.</p>
<p>Scrooge got a closer look at Tiny Tim and saw he was no older than when he had seen him at the Cratchit's house earlier in the evening.</p>
<p>"What of it?" said Scrooge to the Spirit. "Tiny Tim was getting the best medical care his family could afford. Of course the family is sad, but they'll get over it. People die all the time."</p>
<p>At this, the Spirit waved its arm at Scrooge yet again and the hospital room faded away as Scrooge's bed chamber came into focus.</p>
<p>"Finally!" said Scrooge. "Finally one of you Spectres takes me home!"</p>
<p>Scrooge was so pleased to be home, and so tired from his ghostly travels, that he jumped directly into bed without first changing his clothes or pulling back any of the bed curtains. The briefest moment later he jumped right back out so violently that he caused the bed curtains to fall from their poles before running up to the cloaked Spirit.</p>
<p>"How dare you!" said Scrooge, shaking his finger under the Spectre's hood. "How dare you!"</p>
<p>With the bed curtains fallen away, one could see Ebeneezer lying in bed alone, white as a, well, ghost. If one looked carefully at his chest they would discern neither rise nor fall of whatsoever.</p>
<p>"My own death doesn't scare me, Spirit, despite the surprise of coming upon my own corpse in the bed I was ready to sleep in. Your cheap parlor tricks mean nothing. I care not what happens to me after I die for I will no longer be conscious to worry about it, and, before you try to show me what happens to all of my money, know that I care not about that either after I am dead. Money is simply a way to keep score while I am alive; when I am dead let my money go where it may! And before you take me to my graveside service where, I am absolutely sure, there are no mourners, know that I care not about that either! Now take me home!"</p>
<p>After the briefest of hesitations, the Spirit waved its hand at Scrooge a final time. The Spirit seemed to collapse into itself, then disappeared entirely.</p>

<h2>
Stave V<br />The End Of It
</h2>

<p>There was no blow to the head. There was no slipping into unconsciousness. Scrooge blinked and the bed curtains were back in place. He edged to the side of the bed and tentatively pulled back the bed curtain with one finger. </p>
<p>Yes! The bed was his own. The room was his own. Best and happiest of all, the Time before him was his own.</p>
<p>"Thank God!" said Scrooge, then chuckled at what he'd said.</p>
<p>Scrooge took a long hot shower, got himself a nice hot meal, then collapsed into bed and slept all through Christmas and into the next day.</p>
<p>When he awoke bright and early on December the 26th, he immediately opened his window to let in some fresh air. Scrooge breathed deeply, enjoying the cold air washing across his face for a long moment, then looked up into the bright blue sky which was, he noted, gloriously free of be-chained spirits wailing and lamenting the difficulties of others' victimhood.</p>
<p>"Bah! Humbug!" said Scrooge, closing the window then making ready to go to his counting house.</p>
<p>Those who saw Scrooge walking to work that day saw a man renewed; a man with a spring in his step; a man who had glimpsed the tragic comedy of the Heavens themselves and turned away in the knowledge that he was better. To Scrooge's way of thinking, he wasn't sure whether or not any of it had happened, but he was sure it didn't matter; all that mattered was that he lived his life by his Principles of Reason, the very same Principles that allowed him to win at life every day of the year.</p>
<p>When Scrooge got to his counting house, he decided to not start a fire, instead finding pen and paper; what he wrote was simple: Help Wanted, Clerk.</p>
<p>Scrooge sat patiently then, watching his pocket watch as it moved from nine o'clock to nine oh five to nine fifteen. When his watch read nine twenty-three he heard the bell above the door ding and the stomping of feet. Bob Cratchit came into view looking sheepish and worried. </p>
<p>"Running late, Mr. Cratchit?" said Scrooge,  the smallest of smiles touching his lips.</p>
<p>"Sorry, sir. Indeed, sir. I was up late with the family telling Christmas Tales and drinking eggnog by the fire."</p>
<p>"Put this piece of paper in the window," said Scrooge, handing over the 'Help Wanted' sign.</p>
<p>The clerk put the sign in the window then turned to Scrooge.</p>
<p>"You're fired, Mr. Cratchit." said Scrooge, picking up a pen and starting in on the ledgers in front of him; the end of the fiscal year was always busy, so many peoples' money problems became even more problematic during the Holiday Season. He had many properties to foreclose on. "You came in late today despite your promise to come in early."</p>
<p>Bob Cratchit lowered his head and opened the door to leave.</p>
<p>"Oh, Cratchit," said Scrooge, closing the ledger in front of him and looking down his nose at his ex-clerk. "In lieu of two weeks notice and pay, please accept my best wishes for your boy, Tiny Tim."</p>
<p>As Cratchit left the office, Scrooge grabbed another ledger to work on from the very large pile on his desk. He had no further intercourse with Spirits, and had learned to keep Christmas in his heart, in his own way, ever after.</p>
