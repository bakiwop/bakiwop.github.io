Obit written byt Frank:
Francis F. Baiocchi, age 90, of Hartford, WI passed away on April 10, 2024.
He was born November 3, 1933 in Chicago, IL during the Great Depression years to Francis and Esther (nee Betti) Baiocchi, the third of five children in the family: Ralph (1924), Adele (1926), Dolores (1936) and Donald (1939). He attended Catholic elementary schools and began studies for the priesthood at Chicago's Quigley Preparatory seminary in 1947. He earned his BA in philosophy and MA in theology at the University of St. Mary in Mundelein, IL and was ordained to the priesthood May 3, 1960. He was deeply involved in a variety of parish ministries at Saint Giles (Oak Park) and Saint William (Chicago) for ten years, after which he transitioned from celibacy to marriage with Anna Ciamarichello in 1971. He earned a MEd. from Loyola University and then moved to Hartford, WI to teach psychology and social science at the local high school. During his years as a teacher there, he instituted the AP Psychology course for college credits, supervised the summer school program, mentored the school Chess club, coached several community ball teams and was given the coveted Hartford Teacher of the Year award in 1998.
During this time, Francis and Anna raised two children (Matthew and Lisa) and were committed to parish work at St. Kilian as liturgical and Communion ministers, choir members and co-directors of the religious Ed program.
After retiring from teaching at the age of 67, Francis felt a renewed calling to priestly work, so with much help of his wife and support from many others, he founded the Jesus Our Shepherd ("JOS") faith community in 2001 that met weekly in a rural church building for the next 18 years. The JOS people felt called by the Spirit to respond more deeply to the needs of others, and so they did with unbelievable generosity of their time, treasure and talent.
Francis was proud of his Italian Tuscan heritage and of his parents' courage and resilience in the face of their many adversities. He was also proud of the many accomplishments of his children, Matthew and Lisa as well as his fine granddaughter, Lucia. He enjoyed his final years of life with his animal companions Bailey, Rocky and Payton (all of whom were shelter dogs). Yet most of all, Francis treasured his many years of married life with his wife, best friend and lover Anna, for whom he is eternally grateful!
Francis was predeceased by his parents Francis (1899 - 1970) and Ester (1902-1993), by his siblings Ralph (1924-2002), Adele (1926-2018), and Donald (1939-1999). His is survived by his wife Anna, his children Matthew ( Stacy) and Lisa, his granddaughter Lucia and his sister Dolores.
As per Francis' wishes, there will be no funeral nor memorial service. He simply asked that you be kind to each other as you travel the road of life together.
Contributions in memory of Francis are appreciated to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, ASPCA, and or to the American Heart Association.
