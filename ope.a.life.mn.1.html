<p>(Don't miss <a href="https://www.marymackcomedy.com/">Mary Mack's</a> groovy <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Var4_LHTXis">Top the Tater tune</a>.)</p>
<p>From the <em>Star Tribune</em> article:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>For those unfamiliar with Top the Tater, Reddit is a useful primer. "It's called Minnesota crack for a reason," one commenter wrote. "I try not to buy it, otherwise I eat an entire box of chips with top the tater in one or two sittings," another admitted.</p>
	<p>Online, fans share stories of TSA employees calling dibs on Top the Tater tubs they've confiscated from carry-ons. They warn others not to forget to bring it to the cabin ("my sister hasn't spoken to me since"). Or substitute an inferior brand at a family gathering ("one of her uncles threw a hissy fit and actually left to go find it somewhere. After he got back with it, he said it 'wasn't christmas' without top the tater.")</p>
	<p>It's mostly eaten as a chip dip, with Minnesota's Old Dutch Ripples being the go-to. But some swear by Doritos, Fritos, Dot's Pretzels, Bugles and Flamin' Hot Cheetos.</p>
	<p>The creamy spread pairs well with all forms of taters, from French fries to mashed potatoes. But fans also slap it on pizza rolls and bagels. They mix it into tuna salad, potato salad, mac & cheese and scrambled eggs. It can also sub in for cream cheese in a ham-pickle roll-up (aka Minnesota sushi).</p>
	<p>"Not going to lie," a commenter admitted. "Sometimes I just dig in with a spoon."</p>
