<p>Give me money!</p>
<p>
When faced with impossible odds, generations of Americans have responded with a simple creed that sums up the spirit of a people:
<br><br>
Get more money.
<br><br>
People need flat scree TVs.  People need cars.  People need iPods.
<br><br>
I need money.
<br><br>
Running a campaign is not cheap and in order to make change in Washington I need your change now – whatever you can scrounge up.  Go ahead, take a minute to check in the cushions in your sofa, I’ll wait.
<br><br>
Find anything?  Good.  
<br><br>
Men - check your wallet.  Remember that twenty you stashed in the hidden pocket to be used in an emergency?  Well what the heck can you buy with twenty bucks these days, so go ahead, send that on in as well.
<br><br>
Women and cross-dressing men – check your purses.  I know some of you have really big purses and you’ve been wanting to clean them out and organize them for a while now, so why don’t you take a moment and do so.  Go ahead, I’ll wait again.  Find any change?  Good.  Send it on in.
<br><br>
Now how about those bank accounts.  You know that extra money you’ve been setting aside for the vacation?  Well with all the deadlines at work and the kids in school you don’t have time to take that vacation, so go ahead and send me your vacation money.
<br><br>
And don’t forget your 401(k)s your 403(b)s and your other retirement funds.  You are saving for your future – which is good – but exactly what kind of future are you saving for?  With the wrong person in office you won’t have any kind of a future at all.  In order to secure your future today send me your bucks for a better tomorrow.
<br><br>
Change requires change and your change is better than my change so to see the change you want send me your change now.
<br><br>
I am proud and honored to stand with you as we push forward to bring about the reforms that are so desperately needed for our nation's future. To help ensure I have the resources I need, make your contribution today.

<p>Waste your precious time and energy on my campaign so I don't have to! Volunteer today!</p>
<p>
The most important thing you can do to make me President of the United States is to <a href="ope.2008.html#1">give me money</a>, but if you are too cheap or poor to <a href="ope.2008.html#1">give me money</a> then volunteering some time and talent would be okay.
				<br><br>
				I guess.
				<br><br>
				Seriously though, I’m not particularly happy about it.  I mean, can’t you <a href="ope.2008.html#1">give even a buck or two</a>?  Really?  You’ll go thousands in debt to get that flat screen TV but you can’t even <a href="ope.2008.html#1">throw some change my way</a> to make me leader of the free world?  It’s not like I’m <a href="ope.2008.html#1">asking for thousands of dollars</a> here – the fact that you are even on this page instead of the <a href="ope.2008.html#1">give me money page</a> means you’re a cheapskate – but, come on, something?  Anything?  
				<br><br>
				I know, how about you skip that half-caf, low-fat mocha latte for one day to <a href="ope.2008.html#1">give me money</a>.  
				<br><br>
				No?
				<br><br>
				Fine.  Look, if you want to “help” or “volunteer” then so be it, I can’t stop you, but how about calling up some friends and seeing if they have some money to <a href="ope.2008.html#1">give me</a>.  That way you can feel good about yourself for trying to get me elected and I can <a href="ope.2008.html#1">get my hands on some money</a> to run this campaign, okay?
				<br><br>
				Some other ideas for volunteering include:
				<ul>
					<li> Throwing parties - I thoroughly enjoy parties and the free beer that comes with them</li>
					<li>-</li>
					<li> Making a website - Make a website and ask for money for my campaign - and then make sure you give it to me</li>
					<li>-</li>
					<li> Handing out flyers - boring</li>
					<li>-</li>
					<li> Mailing letters - boring</li>
					<li>-</li>
					<li> Calling people - boring</li>

<p>Change.</p>
<p>
You’ll hear many politicians talk about change and how the change they want is better than the change their opponents want even though change is what the last person to get into office was talking about to get elected and we all know how that change turned out.
				<br><br>
				So I want you to take a deep look into your own heart and see what kind of change you expect from a leader.  I want you to make sure that you want change, and once changed, the change is the kind of change you want because once a change is made changing back to the previous change is difficult at best and impossible at worst.
				<br><br>
				So I guess what you have to ask yourself is if change is really what you want or do you want a change in the change being called for from my opponents.  Because their change is all about change but it is the type of change we’ve had in Washington for decades and that kind of change simply isn’t changing the face of politics enough.
				<br><br>
				So we all agree we want change but my change is the kind of change we need because my change has changed from my opponents' (and the previous administrations’) change and will change things not just because it is change or because of change for the sake of change but rather because of the true change we need – the change of the status quo and other appropriate Latin terms.
				<br><br>
				Since my change changes the change being called for from my opponents and previous administrations I can assure you that the change will change the change that is being changed from all the people trying to change.
				<br><br>
				Believe in change because with belief in change there can be belief and change which will bring about change which will cause belief which facilitates change.  Believe!  Change!

    The race between Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama for the Democratic nomination continues to heat up -- but in one Montgomery County, Pa. household, the debate turned violent.

    Prosecutors say that two brothers-in-law tried to settle the presidential race on the kitchen floor of a Collegeville, Pa. home.

<p>From the mailbag:</p>
<blockquote>
    I would like to give you money in the form of a payment for a campaign t shirt/bumper sticker. Especially your "walking for president" slogan. Do you have any such thing set up?
    - Jill D. 
</blockquote>
<p>Jill,</p>
<p>I, unfortunately, have no such thing set up. As you may have gathered from my "walking for president because running is too much damned work" campaign slogan I am a lazy sod and creating items in exchange for campaign contributions seems far too much like work.</p>
<p>There is little concern over all this, however, as presidential campaign donations for items (such as t-shirts, bumper stickers, or plates at a campaign dinner) normally run in the tens of thousands of dollars. Now, if you are from another country, say England, that would amount - after the exchange rate - to about 2.50 British Pounds Sterling. However, I find most Americans unwilling to spend that much money on a bumper sticker or t-shirt.</p>
<p>Even if I were to offer these items for campaign contributions I fear that, after I was elected, I would have to hunt down each and every campaign contributor as they would possess nearly priceless campaign collectibles which could be used to fund terrorist activities.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, after hunting you down and throwing you into a federal penitentiary you would probably not be able to vote for me again as many states have laws against felons voting in elections. Throwing all my campaign contributors into jail would also have the effect of lessening my chances of raising money for my reelection campaign in 2012 and that is a risk I am simply not willing to take.</p>
<p>I do appreciate your interest and hope you manage, somehow, to give me gobs of money at some point in the future.</p>

<p>Hillary went on, "Not a lot of relief, mind you, but some relief for sure. Maybe a bit more than a skosh of relief but not nearly so much as a dollop - more of a tad than a smidgen. Perhaps even an iota or a modicum or a whit but definitely not a pinch or a smattering."</p>
