Officer: "Do you know how fast you were going?"
<br /><br />
Response: "I'm afraid I can't say. Heisenburg's uncertainty principle states that if I am certain of my position, I cannot be certain of my momentum. Since I know exactly where I was, it's impossible to state how fast I was going. Not only that, but by noting my speed, you have irrevocably modified my position, and cannot be sure it was me you were measuring."

<blockquote>"Robbed the wrong train.  Shot in a gunfight in 1911.  His last words were, 'You'll never take me alive!' He was right.  Originally embalmed and displayed in a carnival sideshow, for the next 60 years McCurdy's body was sold to successive wax museums, carnivals, and haunted houses. During filming of the 1977 episode "Carnival of Spies" for the television show The Six Million Dollar Man a crew member was moving what was thought to be a wax mannequin that was hanging from a gallows. When the mannequin's arm broke off, it was discovered that it was in fact the embalmed and mummified remains of a human who was examined by forensic anthropologists and discovered to be Elmer McCurdy."</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The war has become known as the "War in snow and ice," as most of the 600 km frontline ran through the highest mountains and glaciers of the Alps. 12 meters (40 feet) of snow were a usual occurrence during the winter of 1915/16.  The Alpini, as well as their Austrian counterparts: KaiserjÃ¤ger, StandschÃ¼tzen and LandeschÃ¼tzen occupied every hill and mountain top around the whole year. Whole cities were drilled and blown into the mountainsides and even deep into the ice of glaciers like the Marmolada. Guns were dragged by hundreds of troops on Mountains up to 3,890 m (12,760 feet) high. Streets, cable cars, mountain railroads and walkways were built through the steepest of walls. Most of these walkways and streets are still viable today."</blockquote>

[a scientific team] has discovered that sexual orientation in fruit flies is controlled by a previously unknown regulator of synapse strength. Armed with this knowledge, the researchers found they were able to use either genetic manipulation or drugs to turn the flies' homosexual behavior on and off within hours.

Homosexual courtship might be sort of an "overreaction" to sexual stimuli.
