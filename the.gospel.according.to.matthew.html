<h2>
Chapter One
</h2>

<p><sup class="illuminated">1</sup>In the beginning was a persistent Humming, and the Humming was slightly out of tune and frankly a little louder than it needed to be but you could tell that there was an effort and love in the Humming, so that was okay.  The Humming was He and He was the Humming, and He liked the Humming and said, "Gosh."  <sup class="illuminated">2</sup>He also liked the sound of 'gosh' and He named Himself so.</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">3</sup>Gosh Hummed while making all things and all things were made while He Hummed and all things that weren't made weren't made while He wasn't Humming.  <sup class="illuminated">4</sup>For He so liked Humming that without Humming He would make nothing.</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">5</sup>Gosh gazed upon all He had Hummed into existence and felt pride <sup class="illuminated">6</sup>(but that was okay because the seven deadly sins did not apply to Him).  <sup class="illuminated">7</sup>He was so uplifted in spirit when He gazed upon His creation that He said, <sup class="illuminated">8</sup>"By Golly."  <sup class="illuminated">9</sup>And He liked 'by golly' so much that He said it every time He was uplifted in spirit.  <sup class="illuminated">10</sup>Thus He named His spirit By Golly.</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">11</sup>He then looked down upon the humans on earth and thought they looked like they were having a lot of fun and thought He would partake of the fun.  <sup class="illuminated">12</sup>So He went down to earth but nobody would play with Him, <sup class="illuminated">13</sup>for every time someone saw Him they would cry out in fear and fall onto their knees in awe.  <sup class="illuminated">14</sup>He stayed on earth for a while and waited for them to stop it but they didn't so He returned to heaven.  <sup class="illuminated">15</sup>He then tried going down to earth as By Golly but By Golly manifested as a burning bush and the humans kept dousing Him with water.</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">16</sup>He went back to heaven and thought to Himself, <em>that wasn't fun</em>.  <sup class="illuminated">17</sup>So He decided to go to earth as human, <sup class="illuminated">18</sup>well, kind of human, <sup class="illuminated">19</sup>you know, mostly human with a little divine, <sup class="illuminated">20</sup>but definitely the divine was there, <sup class="illuminated">21</sup>as was the human, <sup class="illuminated">22</sup>did I mention the divine? <sup class="illuminated">23</sup>Not that, being divine and all, He'd take advantage or anything, <sup class="illuminated">24</sup>you know, like by cheating on a math test or something.</p>

<h2>
Chapter Two
</h2>

<p><sup class="illuminated">1</sup>Mary and Joseph were making out behind the garden shed when By Golly appeared to them as a Booming Voice and said, <sup class="illuminated">2</sup>"Mary, you are with child."</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">3</sup>Mary stopped doing to Joseph what her friend Esther had taught her and asked, "Joseph, did you hear something?"</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">4</sup>"Joseph said, "Nope, now keep doing that thing you were doing, that was nice."</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">5</sup>They began making out again.</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">6</sup>By Golly cleared His throat, "Ahem," yet they continued to make out.</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">7</sup>By Golly said, "Excuse me," yet they continued to make out.</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">8</sup>By Golly yelled, "Hey!" and the two stopped making out and looked around perturbed.</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">9</sup>By Golly said, "Mary, you are with child."</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">10</sup>Mary and Joseph spoke simultaneously.</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">11</sup>"What!" yelled Mary looking at Joseph.</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">13</sup>"What!" yelled Joseph looking at Mary.</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">12</sup>"You said you wanted to wait until-" "I've never been with anyone-"</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">14</sup>"Enough!" said By Golly.  "I am the Lord Gosh Almighty who has come here as By Golly and will be born unto you as, um, hmmm -"</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">15</sup>"Wait a minute," said Joseph lighting a blunt.  "I've got to mellow out for a second."  He took a couple hits and continued, "You're three gods in one?"</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">16</sup>"That's right.  I'm the Trifecta - the Father, Holy Spirit, and Son."</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">17</sup>"Golly gee," said Mary.  "That's neat."</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">18</sup>"Golly Gee?"  Asked He.  "I like the sound of that."</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">19</sup>"A Trifecta?" asked Joseph.</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">20</sup>"Yes.  I am the Trifecta.  The Father, Holy Spirit, and Son.  The Lord Gosh, By Golly, and born unto you, Golly Gee."</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">21</sup>"So you're your own son?" Asked Mary.  "Isn't that a little redneck?"</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">22</sup>"Yeah," said Joseph, "we're not raising a hillbilly baby."</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">23</sup>"No no no," said By Golly, "it's not like that at all.  I am the Trifecta, but not in an icky way.  It helps if you're like Me - all-knowing - to understand it."</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">24</sup>"Okay," said Mary and Joseph looking at each other, not completely sure, but they figured who were they to go against the Lord Gosh Almighty.</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">25</sup>"Hey," said By Golly staring at Joseph's blunt, "can I get a hit?"</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">26</sup>"But you're omnipotent! Surely you could just miracle into existence the best blunt ever ma-"</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">27</sup>"The best blunt ever made," said By Golly grabbing Joseph's blunt, "is the one you can bogart off someone else."</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">28</sup>Verily, He hit the blunt hard.</p>

Chapter Three
</h2>

<p><sup class="illuminated">1</sup>Gosh Almighty was smoking with Joseph <sup class="illuminated">2</sup>and He did bum all the ganja and not offer to pay.  <sup class="illuminated">3</sup>Joseph did grumble, but not too loudly, and thus missed the punch line to His joke.</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">4</sup>"What?" asked Joseph.</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">5</sup>The Lord Gosh Almighty did say through many giggles, "The guy behind the door says 'Dave's not here, man.'"</p>

<a class="titolo" id="four"></a>
<h2>
Chapter Four
</h2>

<p><sup class="illuminated">1</sup>It came to pass in those days that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be taxed.  <sup class="illuminated">2</sup>And there was much grumbling from the world.  <sup class="illuminated">3</sup>Caesar did hear the grumbling and did decide to make the world go to their hometowns.</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">4</sup>Because he could.</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">5</sup>Joseph went to Hertz to pick up the pack animals he had reserved for the trip earlier in the week.  <sup class="illuminated">6</sup>"This isn't what I ordered!" Joseph yelled.  "It says right here on my receipt: two single-humped dromedaries, two horses, and an ass!"</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">7</sup>"I'm sorry, sir.  All we have left are single-humped camels."</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">8</sup>Joseph did hang his head. "Fine.  Do you at least have any in dark brown with the new non-spit bridles?"</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">9</sup>"I'm sorry, sir.  We only have the light tan models with the old style bridles."</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">10</sup>"Okay...okay.  Give me four of them."</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">11</sup>"I'm sorry, sir.  We only have three left."</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">12</sup>Joseph did think evil thoughts and was glad he was going to have an in with the savior of all humanity.  <sup class="illuminated">13</sup>He took out his wallet to pay the clerk.</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">14</sup>"Would sir be interested in purchasing the insurance we offer?"</p>

Chapter Five
</h2>

<p><sup class="illuminated">1</sup>"Sweetheart," said Mary. <sup class="illuminated">2</sup>"I know you're trying your hardest to find us a room for the night and I'm trying to be patient. <sup class="illuminated">3</sup>Really, I am. <sup class="illuminated">4</sup>But I'm two weeks over due with the Savior of the World, I've just spent the last 77 miles riding through the desert on a camel and I'd really just like to find a place to take a nice bath and kick my feet up, you know?"</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">5</sup>"I even slipped the guy a $20, but he said he was all booked up." said Joseph, slipping off Mary's sandals and rubbing her feet. <sup class="illuminated">6</sup>"We'll check one more place, I think I see an orange roof down the street. <sup class="illuminated">7</sup>It might be a HoJos."</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">8</sup>And Joseph did run toward the orange roof, <sup class="illuminated">9</sup>and lo, it was a Howard Johnson. <sup class="illuminated">10</sup>The night manager did take pity on Joseph's tale and set them up in the manger manager's suite attached to the stables, <sup class="illuminated">11</sup>for he was away in Capernaum for Caesar's tax/registration/census decree thingy.</p> 
<p><sup class="illuminated">12</sup>"That's better," said Mary, slipping into a bath. <sup class="illuminated">13</sup>And her water did break. <sup class="illuminated">14</sup>"Crap," she mumbled under her breath, then shouted, <sup class="illuminated">15</sup>"Honey! You better go find that mid-wife Esther told us about!"</p>

<a class="titolo" id="six"></a>
<h2>
Chapter Six
</h2>

<p><sup class="illuminated">1</sup>On this Night of Nights it did happen that Daniel and Jeremiah, shepherds each, were to stay with their family's flock on the outskirts of Bethlehem <sup class="illuminated">2</sup>when unto them an angel did appear with the great light of the Lord Gosh Almighty and His Heavenly Host singing His praise. <sup class="illuminated">3</sup>The shepherds trembled and Jeremiah did faint.</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">4</sup>"Fear not!" said the angel.</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">5</sup>"Fear not!" sang the host, then hummed in the background.</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">6</sup>"For I, Bob the angel, bring to you tidings of great joy on this lonely night."</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">7</sup>"O' yes he do! O' yes he do! O' yes he do!" sang the host.</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">8</sup>"You humble shepherds shall be the first to witness the coming of our Lord and Savior, Golly Gee!" preached Bob.</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">9</sup>"Golly Gee! Has come for thee! O' Golly Gee!" sang the host.</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">10</sup>"You shall walk!"</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">11</sup>"Walk! Walk! Walk!"</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">12</sup>"Walk down that path!" sang Bob, pointing to a path at the shepherds feet.</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">13</sup>"Walk on down that path!"</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">14</sup>"You'll find your King, the one who'll bring, peace to the world."</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">15</sup>"Peace! Peace! Peace!"</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">16</sup>"He'll be down there!" said Bob, pointing to a distant Howard Johnson.</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">17</sup>"Right down there!"</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">18</sup>"Waiting for you!"</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">19</sup>"You! You! You! You!"</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">20</sup>"Go witness Him, for all the world, now go be true."</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">21</sup>"True! True! True!"</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">22</sup>"Great Golly Gee!" Bob and the Heavenly Host did sing over and over again, clapping their hands, as the Lord Gosh Almighty's light did shine all around them until they faded completely into the starlit night.</p> 
<p><sup class="illuminated">23</sup>Daniel did slap Jeremiah a multitude of times to try and wake him while staring open-mouthed at a piece of paper, illuminated by a single heavenly spotlight, that floated down from where Bob did disappear. The paper landed on Jeremiah with a <em>ting</em>, causing him to wake. <sup class="illuminated">24</sup>Daniel grabbed the paper and read it to Jeremiah, "Bob and the Heavenly Hosts, every Tuesday, 9:30pm, The Heavenly Pub and Grille, Lighting by Gosh, No Cover."</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">25</sup>Daniel did drag Jeremiah with haste down the path to the orange-roofed inn and looked for the night manager to ask where a child was being born but could not call him no matter how many times he rang the front desk bell for service. He heard the sound of raised voices and followed them to the manger manager's room.</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">26</sup>"Is this where it is going to happen?" asked Daniel.</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">27</sup>"No." said Joseph. "The night manager kicked us out into the manger proper because he says his insurance won't cover a 'birthing incident' in the residence part of the hotel."</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">28</sup>The night manager gave Joseph a <em>look</em> and told him, "You can move back into the manger manager's suite after the kid is born," and then headed back to the front desk.</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">29</sup>"Come on you two, Daniel and Jeremiah, right? We've been expecting you. Follow me."</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">30</sup>As they walked around the back of the hotel to the manger, they heard cries of pain.</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">31</sup>"I'm not sure I'm ready for this." Jeremiah said, looking pale.</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">32</sup>"The King of Kings is going to be born in a manger?" asked Daniel. "An actual manger?"</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">33</sup>"Don't get me started," said Joseph. <sup class="illuminated">34</sup>"Come on, He wants you to witness the birth of His Son. Actually, it's Him <em>and</em> His Son, but, well, it's just easier to think of Him as His Son."</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">35</sup>The three men entered the manger <sup class="illuminated">36</sup>and Mary did turn and yell at Joseph, "You are never touching me again!" she said, panting for breath. "Ever!"</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">37</sup>Jeremiah did faint again as Joseph and Daniel backed away, <sup class="illuminated">38</sup>"But honey, I didn't touch you <em>this</em> time!"</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">39</sup>"Don't get smart with me! Out!" she yelled, pointing at the door.</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">40</sup>"But hon-"</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">41</sup>"I said, 'Out!'"</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">42</sup>Joseph and Daniel grabbed Jeremiah and made with haste out the door.</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">43</sup>Mary watched them leave and then concentrated on pushing again. "The Lord Gosh Almighty gave me this child without me feeling anything, you'd think He'd let me give birth to the child without feeling anything either." And the midwife did nod her head in agreement of the silly ways of men, even those who were almighty and eternal.</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">44</sup>The three men waited outside with much hand wringing and worry until they heard the first cry of the newborn King of Kings. They all looked carefully around the doorframe and saw Mary smiling and holding baby Golly Gee. "Come see your son, Joseph."</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">45</sup>Jeremiah did manage to say, "But I thought it was actually the Lord-" before Daniel did slap him upside the head.</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">46</sup>Mary handed Joseph the child and he did beam with happiness and kissed his wife.</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">47</sup>"Hey," said Daniel, "I noticed you have the new Swaddling<sup>&reg;</sup> baby clothes put out by the Romans. Very nice."</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">48</sup>The three men did make coochy coo noises and speak to Golly Gee with high voices while Mary fell asleep. <sup class="illuminated">49</sup>Joseph held the baby and Mary's hand and the shepherds did lower their heads and shuffle their feet. "So," said Jeremiah, "We'll just head out and, um, let the world know about, uh-"</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">50</sup>"Come on Jeremiah, let's go and spread the good word." <sup class="illuminated">51</sup>So Daniel and Jeremiah left and made known what they had seen concerning the Child and all that heard it wondered at that which was told them by the shepherds and what had become of the their flock.</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">52</sup>And the shepherds did return to the manger to find a large group of lookie-loos watching Golly Gee and Mary and Joseph, who were asleep, through the manger door <sup class="illuminated">53</sup>and Daniel did say to Jeremiah, "Oops!"</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">54</sup>Then By Golly came down to Daniel as a turtle dove and perched on his shoulder and said, "If she births Him, they will come," and Daniel was inspired to form a line and charge a small and reasonable fee for people to see the family lying together peacefully in the manger.</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">55</sup>When the last person paid their money and left, Daniel and Jeremiah split the proceeds as instructed by the Bird, leaving 75% for Mary and Joseph and taking 25% and buying new sheep, for their old ones had walked away during the night never to be seen again, <sup class="illuminated">56</sup>although there were legends thereafter amongst the tens of thousands of flocks of sheep that out there, somewhere, was a single flock that had dared break the bonds of tyranny and oppression and roamed free, hither and yon, and would one day return to set all sheep-kind free. <sup class="illuminated">57</sup>But this never came to pass.</p>

Chapter Seven
</h2>

<p><sup class="illuminated">1</sup>The morning after the birth of Golly Gee, three wise men from the East came to Jerusalem and asked King Herod, "Where is the newborn King of Kings? We saw His star from the East and have come to worship Him."</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">2</sup>And Gosh, looking down from the heavens, did slap His forehead. <sup class="illuminated">3</sup><em>These are wise men?</em> He thought to Himself.</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">4</sup>Herod looked at the wise men for a long while and then said, "Let me get this straight. You're telling me that you came all the way over here, into my kingdom, to worship a king who isn't me, but who is in fact an innocent - and extremely defenseless - newborn infant?"</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">5</sup>"Hail to the King Baby," said the wise men.</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">6</sup><em>These are wise men?</em> He thought to himself.</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">7</sup>Herod looked at his scribes and asked why he had not been informed of a newborn baby king. He then asked his astronomers why they had not thought to mention the portentous star. Finally, he asked his chief priests where the newborn baby king was to be born. <sup class="illuminated">8</sup>There was much stammering and bickering amongst his court until Herod did declare that he had had enough. "I shall create a new, official entity named the Department of Homeland Sovereignty. You shall each - scribe, astronomer, and priest - report to the head of the DHS who shall, forthwith, tell me when a new king has arrived in my kingdom!"</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">9</sup>Herod then spoke to the three wise men, "As you can see, this is news to us. I would greatly like to meet this newborn king. Please continue to follow the star and let me know where you find him."</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">10</sup>"Now," Herod continued, "when you leave make sure to give the DHS any liquids in excess of three ounces that you might be carrying on your person. Have a pleasant trip."</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">11</sup>The wise men, miffed at the loss of good bottles of wine and a revolutionary new hair gel which enhanced gloss while providing essential oils that soothed and rejuvenated dry, sand-filled hair, did continue on their journey, following the star until they came to the manger manager's room at the Bethlehem HoJo. <sup class="illuminated">12</sup>There and then the star disappeared, but not before leaving them a flyer for Bob and the Heavenly Hosts, <sup class="illuminated">13</sup>for lo, even angels can be annoyingly self-promotional.</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">14</sup>"You think this is the place?" asked one of the wise men. <sup class="illuminated">15</sup>And the other two did shrug, unsure.</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">16</sup><em>"These are the wise men?"</em> Thought Bob the angel while ascending into heaven.</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">17</sup>The three wise men did figure it out and presented themselves to Mary and Joseph and Golly Gee and gave them treasures of gold, frankincense and myrrh. <sup class="illuminated">18</sup>The gold was used to start a college fund for Golly Gee, <sup class="illuminated">19</sup>the frankincense was smoked with great joy and mellowness, <sup class="illuminated">20</sup>and the myrrh was put on a high shelf in the back of a closet, to be forgotten for all time, as no one knew what it actually was.</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">21</sup>And lo, a "reddish-brown resinous material from a tree" does not count.</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">22</sup>The wise men then left by a different route as they didn't want to lose any more good stuff to Herod. <sup class="illuminated">23</sup>They did mock Herod calling him "Hair-rid" because of his male-pattern baldness and "Hare-rid" for his deep, abiding hatred of fluffy, white bunny rabbits. <sup class="illuminated">24</sup>Herod, upon learning of the wise mens' mockery, was exceeding wroth and slew all white, fluffy bunnies under the age of two in the town of Bethlehem and surrounding coastal areas but then got over it by looking at his treasure rooms chock-full of gold and precious gems. <sup class="illuminated">25</sup>He also tried the revolutionary new hair gel, and behold, it did make his hair softer and more manageable while promoting new growth.</p>

Chapter Eight
</h2>

<p><sup class="illuminated">1</sup>And it came to pass that the Son, Golly Gee, who had descended from heaven as the Holy Spirit By Golly, the Lord Gosh Almighty Himself, creator of all that was explicable and inexplicable, did make poopy in His pants.</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">2</sup>"Holy shit!" Joseph exclaimed, looking over Mary's shoulder.</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">3</sup>"It most certainly is," she replied.</p>

<p><sup class="illuminated">4</sup>"But holy sh-"</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">5</sup>"And then," interrupted Mary, "you pin it here and here. That's all there is to it."</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">6</sup>"But holy shi-"</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">7</sup>"I'll watch you do it the first few times and then we'll both be able to change Him."</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">8</sup>"But it was so <em>green</em>...<sup class="illuminated">9</sup>and <em>runny</em>...<sup class="illuminated">10</sup>and...and that smell! What was that <em>smell</em>? <sup class="illuminated">11</sup>If I didn't know who He was I'd swear it was diabolical!" Joseph did proclaim, unable to take his eyes off Him.</p>

<p><sup class="illuminated">12</sup>"Joseph?"</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">13</sup>"We don't even feed him anything green!"</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">14</sup>"Dear?"</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">15</sup>"And as soon as you took off the soiled diaper the stream of uri-"</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">16</sup>"Joseph!"</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">17</sup>"It arced so high! Where does it all come from?"</p>

<p><sup class="illuminated">18</sup>Mary grabbed Joseph's face with both hands and looked him in the eye. <sup class="illuminated">19</sup>"Honey, everything is going to be all right. I promise."</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">20</sup>"Really?" Joseph asked, looking away from Him.</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">21</sup>"This is what babies do."</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">22</sup>"But the smell!"</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">23</sup>"Yes."</p>

<p><sup class="illuminated">24</sup>"And the green!"</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">25</sup>"Yes.

<p><sup class="illuminated">1</sup>When He was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem after the custom of the feast.</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">2</sup>On their way back to Nazareth, Mary and Joseph were, well, <sup class="illuminated">3</sup>frankly, <sup class="illuminated">4</sup>a bit hungover and too stuffed full of good food to keep their eyes open.</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">5</sup>As they snored on their asses, Golly Gee tarried behind them, then turned back to Jerusalem.</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">6</sup>For He could be sneaky.</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">7</sup>When Mary and Joseph could not find Him among their kinsfolk and acquaintances, they turned back to Jerusalem, seeking Him. </p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">8</sup>And it came to pass, that after three days they found Him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing them, and asking them questions.</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">9</sup>And all that heard Him were astonished at His understanding and answers.</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">10</sup>Well, almost everyone. <sup class="illuminated">11</sup>"Three days!" Mary yelled, grabbing Him by the ear. "Three days!"</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">12</sup>"Mom!" Said Golly Gee, Lord Gosh of Heaven above, Earth below, and Hell even belower. <sup class="illuminated">13</sup>"That hurts!"</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">14</sup>"You're gonna get such a whuppin'!" said Joseph. "Go cut me a switch."</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">15</sup>"You were supposed to be amazed when you saw me," He said. "Like everyone else here!"</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">16</sup>"We are not 'everyone else here,'" said Joseph. <sup class="illuminated">17</sup>"We're your parents and we have sought you with sorrow in our hearts for-"</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">18</sup>"Three days!" yelled Mary again.</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">19</sup>"And how is it that you sought me? Did you not know that I would be about my Father's business?" Asked Golly Gee.</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">20</sup>And they understood not the saying which he spake unto them.</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">21</sup>"Your father's work, huh?" said Mary, finally letting go of His ear. <sup class="illuminated">22</sup>"The only father you need to be worried about these days is Joseph."</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">23</sup>"Madam, I assure you," said one of the doctors, holding his head high and looking down his nose at her, "he has been perfectly safe here with us telling us all wondrous tales of minute entities that infect blood-"</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">24</sup>And verily the doctor did stop when he saw the look upon Mary's face.</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">25</sup>"And don't give us that 'wondrous tales' bull pucky," Joseph said, turning toward the doctor. <sup class="illuminated">26</sup>"This is the Lord Gosh, By Golly, Golly Gee. Of course he knows stuff you don't. He's omniscient, omnipotent, and omnipresent."</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">26a</sup>"Hey ya," said Golly Gee. "I'm omnipresent. I'm already wherever you want me to be."</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">26b</sup>"I don't care if you're omnipresent, you're grounded for a week and will stay in your room," said Joseph.</p>

<p><sup class="illuminated">27</sup>"We're going home," said Mary, giving Golly Gee a look. "Now."</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">28</sup>"Yes, mother," said Golly Gee. And in saying this He increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor with Lord Gosh, His parents, and man.</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">29</sup>And He went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subject unto them: but His parents kept all these sayings in their heart.</p>

<p><sup class="illuminated">7</sup>"Are you supposed to drink Myrrh?" asked the host.</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">8</sup>"I was hoping you knew," replied Joseph.</p>

<p><sup class="illuminated">12</sup>Golly Gee's friends laughed nervously. Mary gave them a look and they quieted, hanging their heads in shame. Mary turned back to Jesus and said with a very measured voice, <sup class="illuminated">13</sup>"'Woman?'" <sup class="illuminated">14</sup>She put her left hand on her hip and pointed at Golly Gee with her right. "If you ever speak to me like that again, I will give you all the trouble your butt has signed up for." She pulled Golly Gee up off His chair. "Now go back into that kitchen and turn water into wine."</p>
<p><sup class="illuminated">15</sup>He did find the kitchen and, having the servants fill six waterpots of stone to the brim with water, turned water into wine. The host thanked him.

<p><sup class="illuminated">19</sup>Joseph walked to Golly Gee, put his arm around His shoulders, and said unto Him, "You will not be doing that with your friends at the oasis." <sup class="illuminated">20</sup>Joseph took a sip of the wine, hugged his Son, and said, "That's some good wine, though." <sup class="illuminated">21</sup>Joseph took another sip.
