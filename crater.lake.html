<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crater_Lake">Crater Lake</a> is amazing. It's a volcanic crater whose rim sits at 8,000 feet. The caldera is 2,148 feet (about half a mile) deep and was formed when Mount Mazama collapsed. No rivers flow in or out of the lake. The lake itself is 1,949 feet deep which makes it the deepest lake in the U.S.. There is a thirty foot tall tree stump that has bobbed vertically in the lake for over a center whose name is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Man_of_the_Lake">The Old Man of the Lake.</a></p>
