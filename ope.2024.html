<p>The greatest barrier to ending racism? Not members of the KKK. Not members of the Proud Boys. Me. Just an average, everyday white person.</p>

	<blockquote><em>"I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in the stride toward freedom is not the White Citizens Councillor or the Ku Klux Klanner but the white moderate who is more devoted to order than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says, 'I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I can't agree with your methods of direct action.'"</em></blockquote>

	<blockquote><em>"I can no longer have this conversation, because we're often coming at it from completely different places.

	<blockquote><em>"Amid every conversation about Nice White People feeling silenced by conversations about race, there is a sort of ironic and glaring lack of understanding or empathy for those of us who have been visibly marked out as different for our entire lives, and live the consequences. It's truly a lifetime of self-censorship that people of colour have to live. The options are: speak your truth and face the reprisals, or bite your tongue and get ahead in life. It must be a strange life, always having permission to speak and feeling indignant when you're finally asked to listen. It stems from white people's never-questioned entitlement, I suppose."</em></blockquote>

<p>He'd been training for this moment his entire life.</p>
<p>Literally his entire life.</p>
<p>The training had kicked up a notch about ten years ago. When he thinks about it, though he rarely does, that's when the training truly began in earnest.</p>
<p>But still...his entire life.</p>
<p>He sat there. Every muscle in his body flexed. Strained. His legs shook from the effort. His face quickly turned pink, then red, as his gaze slowly unfocused, fixed somewhere in the half distance. Sweat dripped from his unkempt hair. His vision grayed around the edges. The veins in his forehead throbbed visibly.</p>
<p>Despite all his training, he'd forgotten to breathe. <em>Breathe, damnit!</em> He shouted inside his head. <em>Breathe!</em> A whimper escaped his throat, a surprised little squeak of a whimper, then he pursed his lips tightly and a long, shaky exhale slowly escaped.</p>
<p>He reversed flow and inhaled through his mouth. It sounded like the air rushing through an open window while driving down the interstate at speed.</p>
<p>When he focused on his breathing he lost focus on everything else. "Come...on," he hissed through gritted teeth. "Concentrate!"</p>
<p>In his attempt to concentrate on the task at hand, he stopped breathing once more. Shortly thereafter he collapsed off the toilet, passed out from exertion and lack of oxygen.</p>
<p>His body immediately relaxed. He began to breathe normally. The thing he'd been training to do his whole life happened. His bowels loosened. Out came a foul-smelling stream of solid and liquid waste smelling of rum, coke, bar pickles, and mayo.</p> 
<p>Hours later when he sobered up enough, his body awoke. He discovered himself on the floor covered in his own filth. Everything ached the acute pain of a kidney stone passing through a ureter. He wiped the side of his face he'd been lying on with his hand and managed only to smear the filth around, getting some in his mouth.</p>
<p>It was okay. He could neither taste nor smell anything.</p>
<p><em>Huh. Chunky.</em> He thought.</p>
<p>He got to his knees, rested his forearms on the toilet lid, and dry heaved a coupe of times. It was there, cozied up intimately to the porcelain toilet, that he finally had his eureka moment: When drinking to the point of debilitating intoxication and constipation, make sure you've had so much that you pass out! The body <em>wants</em> to defecate! Get out of its way so it can do its thing!</p>
<p><em>It's so simple,</em> he thought to himself as he pulled himself up by the grab bars in the handicapped stall of the women's bathroom at The Sloppy Penguin. <em>Why didn't I think of it before?</em> He struggled to pull up his underwear, finally remembered he wasn't wearing any, then pulled up his pants. <em>A decade of heavy drinking and I'm just now figuring out I should pass out to defecate. It's so simple!</em></p>
<p>He stumbled out the bathroom, into the bar, and out the front door where the sun was just starting to lighten the eastern sky. He squinted with pain at the pastel colors, then turned toward the wall of the bar where he saw the hose. He staggered to it, turned on the water, and hosed himself off as best he could.</p>
<p><em>The cold water will help me sober up for the drive home,</em> he thought to himself.</p>
<p>He dropped the hose, water still running, limped to his car, then turned back to look up at the sign on the roof of the bar - it was orange neon and showed a penguin waddling then falling over after getting hit by a flying beer bottle. <em>Yeah,</em> he thought to himself. <em>I can do this.</em> He opened his car door, hopped in, started it, threw it in drive, and pulled out of the parking lot, weaving erratically across both lanes of the county road.</p>
<p>He was very much looking forward to a test run of his new approach to drunken defecation tonight. He smiled, chunky brown bits gleaming on his teeth, as he drove toward the promise of a new day in the rising sun.</p>
