<p>Yesterday morning we woke up early (or, more correctly, I woke up early and Stacy woke up at her regular time), grabbed some donuts from <a href="https://depoebaykery.com/">Depoe Baykery</a> (love the name!), and we went to Depoe Bay to look for some whales.</p>
<p>It should be noted that <a href="https://seagrant.oregonstate.edu/visitor-center/whale-watching">prime whale watching time is mid-December to mid-January and April through May</a> so we were a little late to the party and looked for whales on their way to Baja who were similarly delayed (though probably not because they'd picked up pastries at the best bakery in the area).</p>
<p>No luck. Though we did see the Coast Guard hanging around, running some practice sessions towing a boat through the narrow passage to the bay.</p>
<p><img class="img-thumbnail img-responsive" src="media/pnw.depoe.bay.coast.guard.jpg" alt="Early morning. Sky is painted Easter colors. Sea is slate blue and fairly calm. One Coast Guard ship is towing another Coast Guard ship into port. Even though it’s calm, waves are crashing onto the volcanic rock shore." title="Buddy Coast Guard maneuvers." /></p>
<p>It's cool watching them practice this. The channel they have to navigate is shallow and narrow. Oftentimes they need to line everything up then wait for the correct set of waves to get through safely. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Y9Kk-zBlQ">Check out this video of what it looks like from the boat being towed.</a></p>
<p>It's also neat to note the number of birds chilling on the water. The video at the top of this page doesn't have the greatest resolution, but you can still see a small number of the many birds that were out there in the lower right-hand corner of the video. They're just bobbing along, riding the swells, waiting for breakfast to swim on by.</p>

Wanted to enjoy this book so much. Lake Michigan. Wisconsin. Neat premise. The writing didn't do it for me and after the first one hundred pages I was skimming just to get the gist of the story. The characters left me wanting and the writing, did I mention the writing? I did not click with the writing. And I still want to try the second book in the series because of the premise. Crap.

<p>My mellow is harshed. So crabby this morning. I'm nearly never crabby at work.</p>
<p>I heard coworkers gossiping about other coworkers. Had yesterday off and found I blanked on a patron appointment. The first patron this morning wanted help without me helping them. The second patron I worked with smelled so badly I got a headache. The third, fourth, and fifth patrons were a group who wanted to share every last bit of their genealogy research ad nauseam (which genealogists so frequently do). The sixth patron walked up and down the aisles, loudly belching and farting their way through the library. The seventh patron is one who has been asking the same questions for years, I answer, they're happy, then two or three days later they ask again. The eigth patron finished using the computer, yelled, "Fucking idiots!" farted loudly, then left the building.</p>
<p>It's not often I'm screaming "go away! go away! go away!" inside my head while trying to smile and help a patron. The first hour that's all I was doing.</p>
<p>And I didn't wake up this way. I was in a great mood. Nice little workout. Nice little breakfast. Nice little talk with Stacy. It was wonderful.</p>
<p>Now? Just sitting here at my desk. Hour two underway. The smells have mostly dissipated. The initial flurry of patron interactions have slowed. The crabbiness slowly leeches away. The mellow returns.</p>

<p>The hardest part of working in a public library? The smells.</p>
<p>I once wrote something on Facebook, something like, "the delight of getting your sense of smell back after days of being sick; the distress of it happening at the public library."</p>
<p>Library staff and MLIS profs favorited that saying like nothing I'd done before or since.</p>
<p>Old books smell. I realize there are many people who love the smell of old books. Old books simply smell unpleasantly musty and moldy to me.</p>
<p>Patrons smell. Acceptable personal hygiene seems to be a spectrum. A very large, very stinky spectrum.</p>

<blockquote>
The nucleus of Comet ATLAS (C/2024 G3) held together during a brutal perihelion but not for long. Lionel Majzik of Hungary was the first to report and record dramatic changes in the comet between January 18th and 19th. The bright, strongly condensed head rapidly became more diffuse, a sure sign that its nucleus was disintegrating based on past observations of crumbling comets. His superb sequence, photographed remotely from Chile, clearly reveal the dramatic transformation, which was later confirmed by Australian observers.

Tamara Thomsen was 24 feet underwater when she spotted it: the decaying end of a dugout canoe, a great white oak carved some 1,200 years ago. It was jutting out of a sandy ridge in Wisconsin’s Lake Mendota—a body of water skirting Madison, the state capital—and she knew it was a remarkable find. “What I did not understand was the breadth of the discovery.”

<blockquote>
One hundred years ago, everyone walked in Los Angeles. Some people drove too, but the rules favored the walkers. A dense and extensive network of street railways made walking practical for most people.
It was not the product of car culture, which was a nascent force. The public did not ask for it, and no referendum was held about it. Rather, it was the pet project of LA’s most successful car salesman: Paul G. Hoffman, the owner of America’s biggest Studebaker dealership. He hired a graduate student, Miller McClintock, to write it. And we don’t have to guess about Hoffman’s intentions, because he stated them himself. He commissioned the ordinance to sell more cars.

<blockquote>
The scientists reported using data from the MeerKAT radio telescope array in South Africa to track the slight changes in the timing of radio waves coming from more than 80 pulsars—rapidly spinning, ultra-dense neutron stars. As low-frequency gravitational waves drift by, the pulsars are nudged very slightly, altering the timing of their radio wave emissions by a tiny amount. Astronomers can then use the shifts in those signal times to infer the properties of the gravitational waves.
<br /><br />
The passing gravitational waves “stretch or contract the universe by around 20 meters [about 65 feet] or so,” says Matthew Miles, an astrophysicist at Swinburne University of Technology in Australia and lead author on two of the papers.</blockquote>

<p>It took me years to find good meat out here. When i finaly did? So good. There's this butcher's south of Newport. It's in the back of a rundown industrial park. Loads of abandoned buildings with dead loading docks. Mountains of used tires. Rusted out semi trailers galore. Meandering dirt road between enormous piles of scrap metal. The only sign you're finally in the right place is this bloody plastic strip sheeting covering one of the loading dock entrances. You climb rickety stairs, slide between the stained plastic, and find yourself in front of a small fiberboard counter with a fifty year old cash register on it. You yell for a bit until one of the butchers hears you over their bandsaws. They come over, wiping their bloody hands on their bloody leather aprons, grunt at you, take your order, grunt at you again, then go in back. They come out a couple minutes later with your meat. Cash only. Darn good meat. I really hope it's not human.</p>

Very well written book. Only made it through the second story, <cite>Pics</cite>, though. After reading it I was in a funk, didn't even realize it until Stacy asked me if I was okay. After that I decided to drop the book. But such good writing!

<p>We live in a rural area. Town of about 10,000 folk. When all the hotels and short term rentals are full up it's more like 30,000 people here. But still. We're hemmed in by the ocean to the west, a mountain range to the east (with a single highway through to civilization on the other side), and a mountain pass to the north and the south (leading to hundreds of miles of more coast). It's beautiful. All kinds of beautiful. But sparsely populated.</p>
<p>We miss living in the city. We miss living in the burbs. We miss being surrounded by infrastructure and people and man-made stuff. We miss ring roads and interstates and mass transit. We miss diversity in people and culture and action.</p>
<p>So we're trying to take the time to head to the greater Portland area a couple of times a month. Nothing fancy. Catch a movie. Hit a Barnes and Nobles. Walk around a lake. Find some good ice cream. Hit the tourist stuff. Hit some hidden gems. Simple stuff. Just to be surrounded by people and activity and the city.</p>
<p>So today we went to a fancy outdoor mall in the furthest ring suburb closest to us. Walked around. Checked out a Saks Fifth Avenue (kinda disappointing). Checked out the movie theater (meh popcorn but good soda pop). Checked out a Barnes and Nobles. The Barnes and Nobles was really cool. Stacy and I met on the job at a plasma collection place in St. Paul. We both worked second shift. After work, we'd head to the B&N in Roseville to hang out until they closed at 1am then we'd drive around the city at night. Sometimes we'd head to Como or Lake of the Isles and walk around. Sometimes we'd look for an all night diner to catch a late (late) dinner. Then we'd head home and catch the Olympic broadcast and go to bed.</p>
<p>Today at the B&N I saw a friend's book, <a href="https://search.worldcat.org/title/1350645377"><cite>Fever House</cite></a> by <a href="https://www.keithrosson.com/">Keith Rosson</a>, facing out on the shelves with a written recommendation. I took a pic and sent it to him. He said since we're in town we should come check out his new house. We stopped down, hung out with the family, and got invited to the official housewarming next week.</p>

<blockquote>
In this rare image taken on 19 July, the wide-angle camera on the international Cassini spacecraft has captured Saturn’s rings and our planet Earth and Moon in the same frame.
<br /><br />
The dark side of Saturn, its bright limb, the main rings, the F ring, and the G and E rings are clearly seen; the limb of Saturn and the F ring are overexposed. The ‘breaks’ in the brightness of Saturn’s limb are due to the shadows of the rings on the globe of Saturn, preventing sunlight from shining through the atmosphere in those regions. The E and G rings have been brightened for better visibility.
<br /><br />
Earth, 1.44 billion km away in this image, appears as a blue dot at centre right; the Moon can be seen as a fainter protrusion off its right side. The other bright dots nearby are stars.
<br /><br />
This is only the third time ever that Earth has been imaged from the outer Solar System. The first image was taken by NASA’s Voyager-1 in 1990 and famously titled “Pale Blue Dot”. In 2006, Cassini imaged Earth in the stunning and unique mosaic of Saturn called “In Saturn's Shadow – The Pale Blue Dot”.
