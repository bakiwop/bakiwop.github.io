<p>Yesterday morning we woke up early (or, more correctly, I woke up early and Stacy woke up at her regular time), grabbed some donuts from <a href="https://depoebaykery.com/">Depoe Baykery</a> (love the name!), and we went to Depoe Bay to look for some whales.</p>
<p>It should be noted that <a href="https://seagrant.oregonstate.edu/visitor-center/whale-watching">prime whale watching time is mid-December to mid-January and April through May</a> so we were a little late to the party and looked for whales on their way to Baja who were similarly delayed (though probably not because they'd picked up pastries at the best bakery in the area).</p>
<p>No luck. Though we did see the Coast Guard hanging around, running some practice sessions towing a boat through the narrow passage to the bay.</p>
<p><img class="img-thumbnail img-responsive" src="media/pnw.depoe.bay.coast.guard.jpg" alt="Early morning. Sky is painted Easter colors. Sea is slate blue and fairly calm. One Coast Guard ship is towing another Coast Guard ship into port. Even though itâ€™s calm, waves are crashing onto the volcanic rock shore." title="Buddy Coast Guard maneuvers." /></p>
<p>It's cool watching them practice this. The channel they have to navigate is shallow and narrow. Oftentimes they need to line everything up then wait for the correct set of waves to get through safely. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Y9Kk-zBlQ">Check out this video of what it looks like from the boat being towed.</a></p>
<p>It's also neat to note the number of birds chilling on the water. The video at the top of this page doesn't have the greatest resolution, but you can still see a small number of the many birds that were out there in the lower right-hand corner of the video. They're just bobbing along, riding the swells, waiting for breakfast to swim on by.</p>

<br />
Wanted to enjoy this book so much. Lake Michigan. Wisconsin. Neat premise. The writing didn't do it for me and after the first one hundred pages I was skimming just to get the gist of the story. The characters left me wanting and the writing, did I mention the writing? I did not click with the writing. And I still want to try the second book in the series because of the premise. Crap.

<p>My mellow is harshed. So crabby this morning. I'm nearly never crabby at work.</p>
<p>I heard coworkers gossiping about other coworkers. Had yesterday off and found I blanked on a patron appointment. The first patron this morning wanted help without me helping them. The second patron I worked with smelled so badly I got a headache. The third, fourth, and fifth patrons were a group who wanted to share every last bit of their genealogy research ad nauseam (which genealogists so frequently do). The sixth patron walked up and down the aisles, loudly belching and farting their way through the library. The seventh patron is one who has been asking the same questions for years, I answer, they're happy, then two or three days later they ask again. The eigth patron finished using the computer, yelled, "Fucking idiots!" farted loudly, then left the building.</p>
<p>It's not often I'm screaming "go away! go away! go away!" inside my head while trying to smile and help a patron. The first hour that's all I was doing.</p>
<p>And I didn't wake up this way. I was in a great mood. Nice little workout. Nice little breakfast. Nice little talk with Stacy. It was wonderful.</p>
<p>Now? Just sitting here at my desk. Hour two underway. The smells have mostly dissipated. The initial flurry of patron interactions have slowed. The crabbiness slowly leeches away. The mellow returns.</p>

<p>The hardest part of working in a public library? The smells.</p>
<p>I once wrote something on Facebook, something like, "the delight of getting your sense of smell back after days of being sick; the distress of it happening at the public library."</p>
<p>Library staff and MLIS profs favorited that saying like nothing I'd done before or since.</p>
<p>Old books smell. I realize there are many people who love the smell of old books. Old books simply smell unpleasantly musty and moldy to me.</p>
<p>Patrons smell. Acceptable personal hygiene seems to be a spectrum. A very large, very stinky spectrum.</p>
