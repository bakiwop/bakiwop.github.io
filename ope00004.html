<p>Yesterday morning we woke up early (or, more correctly, I woke up early and Stacy woke up at her regular time), grabbed some donuts from <a href="https://depoebaykery.com/">Depoe Baykery</a> (love the name!), and we went to Depoe Bay to look for some whales.</p>
<p>It should be noted that <a href="https://seagrant.oregonstate.edu/visitor-center/whale-watching">prime whale watching time is mid-December to mid-January and April through May</a> so we were a little late to the party and looked for whales on their way to Baja who were similarly delayed (though probably not because they'd picked up pastries at the best bakery in the area).</p>
<p>No luck. Though we did see the Coast Guard hanging around, running some practice sessions towing a boat through the narrow passage to the bay.</p>
<p><img class="img-thumbnail img-responsive" src="media/pnw.depoe.bay.coast.guard.jpg" alt="Early morning. Sky is painted Easter colors. Sea is slate blue and fairly calm. One Coast Guard ship is towing another Coast Guard ship into port. Even though it’s calm, waves are crashing onto the volcanic rock shore." title="Buddy Coast Guard maneuvers." /></p>
<p>It's cool watching them practice this. The channel they have to navigate is shallow and narrow. Oftentimes they need to line everything up then wait for the correct set of waves to get through safely. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Y9Kk-zBlQ">Check out this video of what it looks like from the boat being towed.</a></p>
<p>It's also neat to note the number of birds chilling on the water. The video at the top of this page doesn't have the greatest resolution, but you can still see a small number of the many birds that were out there in the lower right-hand corner of the video. They're just bobbing along, riding the swells, waiting for breakfast to swim on by.</p>

<blockquote>
The nucleus of Comet ATLAS (C/2024 G3) held together during a brutal perihelion but not for long. Lionel Majzik of Hungary was the first to report and record dramatic changes in the comet between January 18th and 19th. The bright, strongly condensed head rapidly became more diffuse, a sure sign that its nucleus was disintegrating based on past observations of crumbling comets. His superb sequence, photographed remotely from Chile, clearly reveal the dramatic transformation, which was later confirmed by Australian observers.

Tamara Thomsen was 24 feet underwater when she spotted it: the decaying end of a dugout canoe, a great white oak carved some 1,200 years ago. It was jutting out of a sandy ridge in Wisconsin’s Lake Mendota—a body of water skirting Madison, the state capital—and she knew it was a remarkable find. “What I did not understand was the breadth of the discovery.”

<blockquote>
One hundred years ago, everyone walked in Los Angeles. Some people drove too, but the rules favored the walkers. A dense and extensive network of street railways made walking practical for most people.
It was not the product of car culture, which was a nascent force. The public did not ask for it, and no referendum was held about it. Rather, it was the pet project of LA’s most successful car salesman: Paul G. Hoffman, the owner of America’s biggest Studebaker dealership. He hired a graduate student, Miller McClintock, to write it. And we don’t have to guess about Hoffman’s intentions, because he stated them himself. He commissioned the ordinance to sell more cars.

<blockquote>
The scientists reported using data from the MeerKAT radio telescope array in South Africa to track the slight changes in the timing of radio waves coming from more than 80 pulsars—rapidly spinning, ultra-dense neutron stars. As low-frequency gravitational waves drift by, the pulsars are nudged very slightly, altering the timing of their radio wave emissions by a tiny amount. Astronomers can then use the shifts in those signal times to infer the properties of the gravitational waves.
<br /><br />
The passing gravitational waves “stretch or contract the universe by around 20 meters [about 65 feet] or so,” says Matthew Miles, an astrophysicist at Swinburne University of Technology in Australia and lead author on two of the papers.</blockquote>

<p>It took me years to find good meat out here. When i finaly did? So good. There's this butcher's south of Newport. It's in the back of a rundown industrial park. Loads of abandoned buildings with dead loading docks. Mountains of used tires. Rusted out semi trailers galore. Meandering dirt road between enormous piles of scrap metal. The only sign you're finally in the right place is this bloody plastic strip sheeting covering one of the loading dock entrances. You climb rickety stairs, slide between the stained plastic, and find yourself in front of a small fiberboard counter with a fifty year old cash register on it. You yell for a bit until one of the butchers hears you over their bandsaws. They come over, wiping their bloody hands on their bloody leather aprons, grunt at you, take your order, grunt at you again, then go in back. They come out a couple minutes later with your meat. Cash only. Darn good meat. I really hope it's not human.</p>

Clatsop County Coast-Tillamook County Coast-<br />
Central Coast of Oregon-South Washington Coast-<br />
128 PM PST Sat Feb 15 2025<br />
<br />
...BEACH HAZARDS STATEMENT NOW IN EFFECT THROUGH MONDAY MORNING...<br />
<br />
* WHAT...Sneaker waves possible.
<br /><br />
* WHERE...North and Central Coast of Oregon, and South
  Washington Coast.
<br /><br />
* WHEN...Through Monday morning.
<br /><br />
* IMPACTS...Waves can run up significantly farther on a beach
  than normal, including over rocks and jetties. Sneaker waves
  can suddenly knock people off of their feet and quickly pull
  them into the frigid ocean which may lead to serious injury or
  drowning.
<br /><br />
* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Keep children and pets away from the surf
  zone. Keep off of jetties, rocks and logs near the surf zone.
  If you see someone swept into the sea do not swim in after
  them. Call 911 and keep an eye on them until help arrives.
<br /><br />
PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
<br /><br />
Remain out of the water to avoid hazardous swimming conditions.

<blockquote>
In this rare image taken on 19 July, the wide-angle camera on the international Cassini spacecraft has captured Saturn’s rings and our planet Earth and Moon in the same frame.
<br /><br />
The dark side of Saturn, its bright limb, the main rings, the F ring, and the G and E rings are clearly seen; the limb of Saturn and the F ring are overexposed. The ‘breaks’ in the brightness of Saturn’s limb are due to the shadows of the rings on the globe of Saturn, preventing sunlight from shining through the atmosphere in those regions. The E and G rings have been brightened for better visibility.
<br /><br />
Earth, 1.44 billion km away in this image, appears as a blue dot at centre right; the Moon can be seen as a fainter protrusion off its right side. The other bright dots nearby are stars.
<br /><br />
This is only the third time ever that Earth has been imaged from the outer Solar System. The first image was taken by NASA’s Voyager-1 in 1990 and famously titled “Pale Blue Dot”. In 2006, Cassini imaged Earth in the stunning and unique mosaic of Saturn called “In Saturn's Shadow – The Pale Blue Dot”.
