				#ope - We miss living in the city. We miss living in the burbs. We miss being surrounded by infrastructure and people and man-made stuff. We miss ring roads and interstates and mass transit. We miss diversity in people and culture and action.

				#books - DNF'd Rejection by Tony Tulathimutte. Very well written book. Only made it through the second story, Pics, though. After reading it I was in a funk, didn't even realize it until Stacy asked me if I was okay. After that I decided to drop the book. But such good writing!

				#writing  - He wobbled to a stop, barely able to hold up the 850 pound chrome monster while getting the kickstand down. "Brothers!" he yelled, fist bumping the waiting trio. "Brother!" they harrumphed ...and having validated their Harleyness they mounted their rolling metal and made noise...booming stentorian noise ...and pulled out past children holding their hands to their ears and parents clucking their tongues in disapproval â€“ for this is what they lived for, making the world know they were the biggest and loudest bad asses on the planet and their passage would be marked through sound of exhaust, shine of chrome, and drip of oil.
