				#ope - Always weird when I have a Sunday/Monday off of work. Yesterday we went to Newport, OR's Nye Beach, a trendy little area with lots of shops and restaurants and art galleries. It's cool because it has narrow streets and the shops are all right up against each other and there are hidden alleys and sidewalks everywhere. When we moved out here.....

I like it too much to leave it out but am too lazy to integrate it properly, so here it lays. The image above is The Great Wave off Kanagawa by Katsushika Hokusai.....

				#ope - Sick day yesterday taking care of Stacy. I was to be the driver should she have needed to go to the hospital. Neither of us thought she would need to go to the hospital, but since we're not medical professionals we thought we'd both take a day off just in case. You know, you can't be too careful with these things....

				The Echo Mountain Complex Fire took place over a week or so in 2020. This entry begins on 6 September. Not my best writing, but it's too gosh darned long to rewrite while being important enough to want to remember. Not all the links below work anymore....

				#mattifesto - I've worked for the Washington Post since 2008 as an editorial cartoonist. I have had editorial feedback and productive conversations—and some differences—about cartoons I have submitted for publication, but in all that time I’ve never had a cartoon killed because of who or what I chose to aim my pen at. Until now....
