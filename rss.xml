				#library - Went to a copyright conference in Portland yesterday. PSU. Kinda cool being in a bigger city again. Lots of life. Chaos. Totes fun. The conference was very informative and well done. The presenters were interesting and fun. Stacy came along and worked in the library. We walked around campus. Ate street food. Got lost. Good times.

				#library - Two potentially stress inducing occurrences at work this morning. Opened the door. Boom! There they were. Sneaky little buggers. Hadn't even opened yet. But I'm feeling fine. Easy breezy. The library mellow has returned.

				#library - I once wrote something on Facebook, something like, "the delight of getting your sense of smell back after days of being sick; the distress of it happening at the public library."

				#library - It's not often I'm screaming "go away! go away! go away!" inside my head while trying to smile and help a patron. The first hour that's all I was doing.

				#pnw - Yesterday morning we woke up early (or, more correctly, I woke up early and Stacy woke up at her regular time), grabbed some donuts from Depoe Baykery (love the name!), and we went to Depoe Bay to look for some whales....

				#ope - But, come on, how cool would it be to live in a place where the sun doesn't rise for 66 days in the winter or set for 80 days in the summer....
