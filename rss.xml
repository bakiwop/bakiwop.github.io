			<title>The Winter of My Discontent</title>

			<description>

				I have a high tolerance for boredom. Always have had. On those exceedingly infrequent occasions when I begin to feel boredom crawling across my brain, moving like a marine layer off the ocean insinuating itself into civilization, creeping amongst the narrow winding roads and cedar-sided cabins on the headlands and promontories bumping up to the sea, well, I know I'm in for a couple hours of happy fun time.
