				#library - Went to a copyright conference in Portland yesterday. PSU. Kinda cool being in a bigger city again. Lots of life. Chaos. Totes fun. The conference was very informative and well done. The presenters were interesting and fun. Stacy came along and worked in the library. We walked around campus. Ate street food. Got lost. Good times.

				#library - It's not often I'm screaming "go away! go away! go away!" inside my head while trying to smile and help a patron. The first hour that's all I was doing.

				#pnw - Yesterday morning we woke up early (or, more correctly, I woke up early and Stacy woke up at her regular time), grabbed some donuts from Depoe Baykery (love the name!), and we went to Depoe Bay to look for some whales....
