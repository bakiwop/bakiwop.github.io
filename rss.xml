				#mattifesto - Singer Ethel Cain: She added that "the men in charge better hope they can keep their digital smokescreens running as long as they can" because "all hell is gonna break loose" if ordinary left-wing and right-wing people "realise they have the same enemy"..

			<title>Late January</title>
			<link>https://baki.cc/ope00003.html#024</link>
			<description>

				#pnw - Most every year, late January is a time of sun on the coast. We seem to get a week or two reprieve to the otherwise very rainy, very wet season. I've been told that with the sun comes the cold. This year it's proven to be true as we've hit the 30s every night for the past week and a half.

				#mattifesto - From Chapter 31: The Poor People's Campaign of the Autobiography of Martin Luther King Jr., "And I come by here to say that America too is going to hell if she doesn't use her wealth. If America does not use her vast resources of wealth to end poverty and make it possible for all of God's children to have the basic necessities of life, she too will go to hell."

				#pnw - I didn't catch the roar (scream?) when it began, but it all happened at once from a dead silence. It was creepy and exhilarating. It was a grab you by the amygdala and flood your body with adrenaline kinda thing....
