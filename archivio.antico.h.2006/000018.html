<h4>It's An Honor To Be Your Honor When...</h4>
by Billy Bob Bubba Hotep
<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - Transcript of John Robert's Confirmation Speech</p>
<p>(Applause)</p>
<p>John Roberts:  Thank you very much.  Let me begin by thanking President Bush, Justice John Paul Stevens, my beautiful wife Jane, my wonderful kids, my dear mother, my father, my 5th grade Social Studies teacher...</p>
<p>(Orchestra Music Begins)</p>
<p>John Roberts:  Don't you start playing that music yet!  Don't you dare!</p>
<p>(Orchestra Music Stops)</p>
<p>(Laughter)</p>
<p>John Roberts:  I'd like to thank the remarkable team that assisted me throughout the nomination process, Ed Gillespie, Senator Thompson, let's see, did I forget anyone?  Harriet Miers, Bill Kelley, and...just...just...everyone on the team.  I am very grateful to each and every one of you.  Oh yes, and I'd like to thank God, the Lord above, without who none of this would be possible.</p>
<p>John Roberts:  Senator Frist, Senator Leahy, other members of the Senate whose names I cannot recall right now, I view the vote this morning as a confirmation of what is for me a bedrock principle, that judging is different from politics.  And I appreciate the vote, very much.</p>
<p>John Roberts:  I'd especially like to thank all the members of the Senate who voted for me - your parking tickets will be taken care of and you will be receiving those little blue handicapped parking signs that you can hang on the back of your rear view mirror within the next three days, as promised.  And for those of you who didn't vote for me, neener...neener...neener.</p>
<p>John Roberts:  The process we have just completed epitomizes the separation of powers that is enshrined in our Constitution.  My nomination was announced some ten weeks ago here in the White House, the home of the executive branch.  This morning, further up Pennsylvania Avenue, it was approved in the Capitol, the home of the legislative branch.  And tomorrow I will go into the Supreme Court building to join my colleagues, the home of the judicial branch, which is, let's face facts, the most powerful branch of government.  After all, it was the judicial branch that picked the president in the 2000 presidential election and we get to decide what is and what is not constitutional.  The executive and the legislature have carried out their responsibilities and ensured the succession of authority in the judicial branch.  And they will all bow before me, Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts, their chosen God!</p>
<p>John Roberts:  What Daniel Webster termed, "the miracle of our Constitution" is not something that happens every generation, but looking out upon the other Supreme Court Justices here today, I see it will happen fairly often during this generation.  You are all a bunch of old, decrepit, black-robe-wearing geriatrics and I look forward to serving with your replacements.</p>
<p>John Roberts:  Die, old folks, die!</p>
<p>John Roberts:  Every generation must, in its turn, accept the responsibility of supporting and defending the Constitution, and bear true faith and allegiance to it.  As opposed to not-so-true faith and the kind of allegiance that most people show their church, you know, the kind where you only show up and participate twice a year on Christmas and Easter?</p>
<p>John Roberts:  Thank you Mr. President.  Thank you members of the Senate.  And thank you colleagues for being here to share this special moment.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts has left the building.</p>
<p>(Applause)</p>
