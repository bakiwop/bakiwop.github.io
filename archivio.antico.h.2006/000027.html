<h4>Bush and Rumsfeld - Whoopsee Daisy</h4>
by Ang&eacute;l&iacute;n&aacute; M&oacute;l&iacute;n&aacute; Ch&iacute;q&uacute;&iacute;t&aacute; &Aacute;l&oacute;nz&oacute; R&uacute;d&oacute;lph&oacute; C&uacute;&eacute;rv&oacute; D&oacute;s&Eacute;q&uacute;&iacute;s M&aacute;rq&uacute;&eacute;z
<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In the Spring of 2003 President Bush told the crew of the USS Abraham Lincoln that the conflict in Iraq had ended and gave a speech in front of a "Mission Accomplished" banner.  This past Monday Bush stated, "not only can we win the war in Iraq, we are winning the war in Iraq." Then, at a press conference, Rumsfeld told reporters that catching Osama bin Laden was still a priority. Finally, later the same day, Rumsfeld stated he thought Osama might still be alive.</p>
<p>Seem a little backwards?  White House analyst David Greer explains.</p>
<p>"It's really quite simple.  You see, what must have happened is what we in the business call a 'whoopsee daisy', that is to say when the overall plan on terrorism was presented to our Commander-in-Chief and the Secretary of Defense they must have been reading the plan upside down."
<p>"The obvious correct order of things is to verify that Osama is alive and catch him for what he did on 9/11 and <em>then</em> attack Iraq for whatever the reason was and <em>then</em> say we are winning the war in Iraq and <em>then</em> say we won the war in Iraq.</p>
<p>"Because they read it upside down, they got it backwards."</p>
<p>"Simple mistake, really."</p>
