<h4>Bush Mispronounces <span class="white">Nevada</span>, But Gets Prostitution <span class="white">And</span> Gambling Correct</h4>

<p>President Bush visited Las Vegas earlier this week, which marked the first time the President has visited the Silver State in an official capacity.</p>
<p>In his presidential address, Bush repeatedly pronounced Nevada, Ne-vah-da, until a reporter covering the speech yelled, "The middle syllable should rhyme with the 'a' in gambling." Once an aide explained to the President what a syllable was and helped him count to two, the President interrupted his set speech with a story.</p>
<p>"Ah yes," the President said, "I remember gambling fondly."</p>
<p>"You know," he continued, "this really isn't my first visit to this state. Back in my National Guard days, I often came up here for the gambling and the prostitution."</p>
<p>"Yes," the President went on with a far-off look in his eye, a small smile playing on his lips, "the gambling and the prostitution were nice - oh so very nice - but I found that while I often came for the gambling and prostitution, I stayed for the drug use. Nevada, my fellow Americans, holds a place near and dear to my heart. That is why I am here today..."</p>
<p>President Bush then continued on with his prepared speech, pronouncing Nevada correctly for the remainder of his visit.</p>
