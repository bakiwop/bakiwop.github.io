<h2 class="name" align="center">Now is the Summer of Our Discontent</h2>	
<p align="center">
Summer reading has arrived. Now is the summer of our discontent.</p>	 
<br />


<p>
Now is the summer of our discontent<br />
Made horrendous winter by this kids' program;<br />
And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house <br />
In the deep bosom of the ocean buried. <br />
Now are our brows furrowed concern and despair;<br /> 
Our monuments draped with children's play; <br />
Our merry meetings changed to stern alarums, <br />
Our delightful measure to dreadful marches. <br />
Grim-visaged war hath wrinkled his smooth'd front;<br /> 
And now, we all must mount the barded steads <br />
To fright the souls of fearful adversaries, <br />
Who caper nimbly in a children's lib'ry <br />
To the sonic screeching of wailing siren <br />
But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks, <br />
Nor made to chase an energetic devil; <br />
I, that am rudely stamp'd, and want silence's majesty<br /> 
To strut before a coffee maker full; <br />
I, that am curtail'd of this fair proportion,<br /> 
Cheated of comfort by destructive nature, <br />
Deformed, unfinish'd, sent before my time <br />
In children's programming world, scarce half made up, <br />
And that so lamely and unfashionable <br />
That kids scream at me as I read to them; <br />
Why, I, in this strong piping time of conflict, <br />
Have no delight to pass away the time, <br />
Unless to spy my shadow in the sun <br />
And descant on mine own deformity: <br />
And therefore, since I cannot provide my peace,<br /> 
And entertain these fair well-spooked days, <br />
I am determined to prove a villain <br />
And hate the reading pleasures of these youths.<br /> 
Plots have I laid, inductions delicate, <br />
By drunken prophecies, libels and dreams, <br />
To set the youngsters and their siblings <br />
In deadly hate the one against the other: <br />
And if a juvenile be as true and just <br />
As I am subtle, false and treacherous, <br />
This day should young ones closely be mew'd up,<br /> 
About a prophecy, which says that they <br />
Of all our heirs the readers shall be. <br />
Dive, thoughts, down to my soul: here <br />
The moppets arrive.<br />
